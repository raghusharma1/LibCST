Scenario 1: Initialization with default state
Details:
    TestName: test_initialization_default
    Description: Verifies if the function __init__ set default attributes as expected.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an object from the class that contains the __init__.
    Act: Nothing as this is about the initial state.
    Assert: Verify the 'qux' attribute is equal to 3. Verify the 'spam' attribute is equal to 4.
Validation:
    Ensuring that the default state of the object is correct is crucial to guarantee that the system behaves as expected under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Effect of modifying object's attributes
Details:
    TestName: test_modify_attributes
    Description: Tests if the object's attributes (qux and spam) can be modified as expected after object creation.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an object from the class containing the __init__ function.
    Act: Change the 'qux' attribute to 5, and the 'spam' attribute to 6.
    Assert: Confirm that the 'qux' attribute is equal to 5. Confirm that the 'spam' attribute is equal to 6.
Validation:
    This test is important to ensure that object's attributes can be modified after initialization. Hence, ensuring correct object behavior and data manipulation.

Scenario 3: Resetting object's attributes to default
Details:
    TestName: test_reset_to_default
    Description: Tests if the object's attributes (qux and spam) can be reset to their default values after being modified.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an object from the class containing the __init__ function and modify the 'qux' and 'spam' attributes.
    Act: Call the __init__ function on the modified object.
    Assert: Check if the 'qux' attribute is reset to 3 and the 'spam' attribute is reset to 4.
Validation:
    It's important to ensure that the '__init__' function correctly resets object states, particularly when objects need to be reused or re-initialized in certain scenarios.
