Scenario 1: Test when Lol (Coroutine) Completes Successfully
Details:
  TestName: test_function_completion
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function `inner` handles successful completion of coroutines correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a coroutine object (async function) that is supposed to complete successfully.
  Act: Invoke the `inner` function passing the coroutine object.
  Assert: Verify that the coroutine has been awaited successfully.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `inner` function is capable of awaiting the given coroutine correctly, if the coroutine completes normally. This behavior is crucial for the routine execution of business logic encapsulated by `inner`.

Scenario 2: Test when Lol (Coroutine) Raises an Exception
Details:
  TestName: test_function_exception
  Description: This scenario aims to test how the function inner behaves when the passed coroutine Lol raises an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a coroutine that raises an exception when awaited.
  Act: Run the  `inner` function passing the exceptional coroutine.
  Assert: Check to see if the `inner` function propagates the exception correctly.
Validation:
  The significance of this test lies in ensuring that exceptions raised by awaited coroutines are propagated correctly by the `inner` function. This is important in error detection and handling for the main function.

Scenario 3: Test when calling inner without Lol
Details:
  TestName: test_function_without_Lol
  Description: This scenario is meant to test if the function inner can handle being invoked without passing a coroutine Lol.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no coroutine to be passed in this case.
  Act: Invoke the `inner` function without passing any coroutine.
  Assert: Ensure that an appropriate exception is raised.
Validation:
  The importance of this test lies in ensuring that the `inner` function behaves as expected when invoked without passing a coroutine. This test aids in compliance with API specifications, which mandatorily require a coroutine Lol to be passed.

Scenario 4: Test when Lol (Coroutine) Lasts Longer Than Expected
Details:
  TestName: test_function_long_execution
  Description: This scenario is intended to verify whether the function `inner` can handle cases where the coroutine takes longer time to complete than expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a coroutine that takes more time than the expected time-limit to complete.
  Act: Invoke the `inner` function, passing the long-running coroutine.
  Assert: Verify that the function `inner` manages the long-running coroutine correctly, for example, by timing out or continuing to wait until the coroutine completes, depending on its designed behavior.
Validation:
  The significance of this test stems from ensuring that `inner` efficiently handles coroutines that run for unexpected lengths of time. This becomes a critical test in situations where the business logic encapsulated by coroutines can take variable time to execute.
