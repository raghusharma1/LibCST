The provided code snippet (definition of function f) contains syntax errors. No valid Python function can contain syntax such as "pass ; break ; continue ; return ; return foo". Before proposing test scenarios, a clear definition of the function is required. 

Assuming there's some misunderstanding in the question and the function might be something like this:

```python
def f(foo, bar, a):
    assert foo, bar
        
    a += 2
    return a
```
Then test scenarios can be written based on this defined function.

---
Scenario 1: Checking the assert statement with valid foo and bar values
Details:
  TestName: test_assertion_with_valid_params
  Description: Test is intended to verify if the assert statement is functioning properly when foo and bar have valid truthy values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare valid truthy values for foo and bar variables.
  Act: Call the function f(foo, bar, a) with prepared parameters.
  Assert: Expect that function completes without assertion error.
Validation:
  It's important to check that function handles truthy values without any errors. This ensures function's proper functioning when provided with valid inputs.

---
Scenario 2: Checking the assert statement with invalid foo and bar values
Details:
  TestName: test_assertion_with_invalid_params
  Description: Test is to verify that function raises AssertionError when foo and bar are falsy.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare falsy values for foo and bar variables.
  Act: Call the function f(foo, bar, a) with prepared parameters.
  Assert: Function is expected to raise AssertionError.
Validation:
  Checking function's behavior with falsy inputs identifies potential bugs and confirms the function behaves as expected when encountered with invalid or unexpected inputs.

---
Scenario 3: Checking the increment and return statement
Details:
  TestName: test_increment_return
  Description: Test is designed to check whether the function f increments the variable 'a' by 2 and returns the correct value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize foo and bar with truthy values, and 'a' with any integer.
  Act: Call the function f(foo, bar, a) with prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that function returns the value of 'a' incremented by 2.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the increment operation is working correctly and function returns the accurate result. Proper functioning of such basic operations is crucial for the overall algorithm correctness.

Note: As Python is a dynamically typed language, edge cases concerning handling of different data types are not mentioned in above scenarios. They can be added whenever necessary depending on the exact business requirements.
