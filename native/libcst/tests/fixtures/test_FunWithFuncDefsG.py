As the function g lacks a body and real parameters, the following scenarios are hypothetical and based on general practices. In order to write useful scenarios, more specific function description is required. Nevertheless, the general structure of these scenarios can be applied to any function when it's properly defined.

```Scenario 1: Verify default function behavior
Details:
  TestName: test_default_function_behavior
  Description: This test validates if function g can be invoked without any error using a valid value of parameter 'a'.
Execution:
  Arrange: The environment is the python runtime, no other preparations are required.
  Act: Call the function g with an integer value 5.
  Assert: Verify if the function completes the execution without throwing any exception.
Validation:
  This test will verify if the function g is capable of a simple invocation, which is the base level operation it should support, according to its definition.

```

```Scenario 2: Verify for non-valid inputs 
Details:
  TestName: test_g_with_nonvalid_inputs
  Description: This test validates if function g handles non-valid values for the parameter 'a' correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: The environment is the python runtime, no other preparations are required.
  Act: Call the function g with an undefined variable input.
  Assert: The function should throw a NameError.
Validation:
  This test will check if the function g fails softly upon receiving an invalid input, as per Pythonâ€™s principle of 'Errors should never pass silently'.

```

```Scenario 3: Checking function execution timing
Details:
  TestName: test_g_execution_time
  Description: This test verifies if function g completes the execution within an acceptable time interval.
Execution:
  Arrange: The environment is the python runtime, no other preparations are required.
  Act: Use pytest's 'time' fixture to track the execution time while calling function g with a complex input.
  Assert: Verify if the execution time is less than or equal to a predefined maximum acceptable time.
Validation: 
  This test will ensure that the function g is meeting performance requirements, a crucial aspect for real-world applications.
