```
Scenario 1: Test the Proper Working State of Function Main
Details:
  TestName: test_function_main_normal_working
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function main performs its operations correctly without errors when invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the os.chdir, var CWD and run functions, and also the necessary file paths and proper `.py` files in the test_root directory. 
  Act: Call the main function.
  Assert: Check that the functions os.chdir, run and gen_cache are called with the correct arguments, and that the json files are generated correctly.
Validation:
  This test is important as it validates the correct functioning of the main function in normal, ideal conditions. The result matches the function specification that it should execute these steps in the order without errors, and thus it meets the business requirements.

Scenario 2: Failure during the Execution of Pyre Start Command
Details:
  TestName: test_function_main_failure_pyre_start
  Description: This test is intended to validate the proper handling of the function main when the first Pyre command execution fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the os.chdir and run functions in a way that the `run(["pyre", "-n", "start", "--no-watchman"], check=True)` command fails.
  Act: Call the main function.
  Assert: Check that an exception is caught, no subsequent commands are executed, the directories are restored and the Pyre stop command executed.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the robustness of main function against possible errors during the execution of the Pyre start command, conforming to the business requirements of error resilience.

Scenario 3: No Python File in the Test Root Directory
Details:
  TestName: test_function_main_no_python_file
  Description: This test is intended to confirm the correct handling of the situation where the test_root directory has no `.py` files.
Execution:
  Arrange: Modify the test_root directory to have no Python files.
  Act: Call the main function.
  Assert: Check that the program finishes without error and without processing any Python files, stops Pyre and returns to the original directory.
Validation:
  This important test ensures the program handles the lack of `.py` files gracefully and continues its execution, validating the expected behaviour of the main function when dealing with an empty directory. This matches the business requirement of graceful error handling.

Scenario 4: Failure during JSON File Generation
Details:
  TestName: test_function_main_json_file_generation_failure
  Description: This test is designed to validate the function's handling of exceptions that can occur during the JSON file generation process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Manipulate the file handling process in such a way that errors will occur during the JSON file generation.
  Act: Call the main function.
  Assert: Check that the program catches the exception, stops Pyre and returns to the original directory without finishing the JSON file generation process.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms the main function's durability against unexpected exceptions during JSON file generation while maintaining the business requirements of error resilience and task execution integrity.
