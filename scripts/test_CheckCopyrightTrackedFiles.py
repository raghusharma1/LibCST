Scenario 1: No Files in Git Repository
Details:
  TestName: test_tracked_files_empty_repository
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles the case of an empty git repository, returning an empty iterable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a git repository with no tracked files.
  Act: Invoke tracked_files function.
  Assert: Assert that the output is an empty iterable.
Validation:
  It is crucial to ensure the function can handle edge cases like an empty repository without failing or returning incorrect data.

Scenario 2: Tracking Files With Different Extensions
Details:
  TestName: test_tracked_files_various_extensions
  Description: This test checks that the function only returns the file paths for Python and shell script files, excluding others.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a git repository tracked files, including '.py', '.sh', '.txt', and '.md' file types.
  Act: Invoke tracked_files function.
  Assert: Assert that the returned iterable only includes Python and shell script file paths.
Validation:
  The function's purpose is to filter out undesired file types from what git tracks. Therefore, this test verifies that this filter works correctly.

Scenario 3: Ignoring Files Matching Exception Patterns
Details:
  TestName:test_tracked_files_with_exception_patterns
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly ignores files that match the exception patterns.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a git repository with Python and shell script files that match and don't match the exception patterns.
  Act: Invoke tracked_files function.
  Assert: Assert that the returned iterable doesn't include file paths matching any exception pattern.
Validation:
  The function's purpose includes filtering out certain files based on pre-defined EXCEPTION_PATTERNS. This test verifies this part of the business logic.

Scenario 4: Non-Existent File Paths
Details:
  TestName: test_tracked_files_non_existent_paths
  Description: This test checks whether the function correctly handles file paths that do not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a git repository with Python and shell script files, including one non-existent file path.
  Act: Invoke tracked_files function.
  Assert: Assert that the returned iterable doesn't include the non-existent file path.
Validation:
  The function filters out file paths that don't exist, thereby protecting against potential program crashes if those paths were erroneously used later.

Scenario 5: Git Command Error
Details:
  TestName: test_tracked_files_git_error
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles an error in the git command and raises the right exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a git command error.
  Act: Invoke tracked_files function.
  Assert: Assert that the function raises the right type of exception.
Validation:
  Mistakes in the git command can happen, and the function needs to handle them gracefully without crashing and providing useful error information.
