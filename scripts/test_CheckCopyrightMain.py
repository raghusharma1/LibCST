Scenario 1: When the tracked files have the expected headers
Details:
  TestName: test_files_with_expected_headers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method handles properly the case when all tracked files include the expected headers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Populate a set of tracked files with text including the expected header.
  Act: Invoke the main function.
  Assert: Check that the function ends with exit code 0 (success).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly recognizes and confirms the presence of expected headers in tracked files.

Scenario 2: When some tracked files miss the expected headers
Details:
  TestName: test_files_without_expected_headers
  Description: The purpose of this test is to ensure that the function correctly identifies and reports any tracked files missing the expected headers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mix of tracked files, some containing the expected header and others not.
  Act: Invoke the main function.
  Assert: The execution should exit with an error code 1, and output messages indicating which files are missing the header.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the function's capability to accurately identify and flag discrepancies in the header content of the tracked files.

Scenario 3: Empty tracked files
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_files
  Description: This scenario is intended to check the function's behavior when dealing with empty files.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a collection of empty tracked files.
  Act: Invoke the main function.
  Assert: The function should exit with an error code as the files don't have any headers, and print out messages indicating each missing file header.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function handles empty files properly, considering them as missing the expected headers.

Scenario 4: Handling large number of tracked files
Details:
  TestName: test_large_number_files
  Description: This test ensures that the function can handle a large number of tracked files without error or performance degradation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large number of tracked files with random contents.
  Act: Invoke the main function.
  Assert: The function should return with a corresponding exit code (success or failure depending on the presence of the headers), and output messages if any file is missing the header.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can scale and work with an extensive file collection.

Scenario 5: No Tracked Files
Details:
  TestName: test_no_tracked_files
  Description: This test validates the function's execution when there are no tracked files.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure no tracked files exist.
  Act: Invoke the main function
  Assert: The function should complete successfully with exit code 0 as there are no files to inspect.
Validation:
  This verifies that the function behaves correctly even if there's no file to process, preventing any inadvertent errors.
