Scenario 1: Marking function as no-op and verifying the attribute
Details:
  Testname: test_mark_no_op_verification
  Description: This test is intended to verify whether the function is successfully marked as no-op and whether the attribute '_is_no_op' is correctly set on the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a sample function that will be used for testing.
  Act: Call the 'mark_no_op' function with the sample function as a parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the '_is_no_op' attribute is set True on the sample function.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the 'mark_no_op' function is able to successfully annotate a function with an '_is_no_op' attribute, thereby specifying it as a batch operation function and reducing function call overhead.

Scenario 2: Confirming no change to function behavior after mark_no_op
Details:
  Testname: test_mark_no_op_no_func_change
  Description: After marking a function as no-op, its functionality shouldn't be affected. This test verifies this behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a simple function with a known return value, then use 'mark_no_op' to mark it.
  Act: Execute the marked function.
  Assert: Confirm that the return value of the marked function matches the known output.
Validation:
  Even after marking a function as no-op, it should operate as originally intended per the business requirement. This test scenario validates this essential behavior.

Scenario 3: Confirming invalid function marking raises appropriate error
Details:
  Testname: test_mark_no_op_invalid_function
  Description: This test verifies that attempting to mark an invalid function (non-function objects for instance) as no-op raises the appropriate error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an invalid function (like a string or integer).
  Act: Try invoking 'mark_no_op' function with this invalid function.
  Assert: An error should be raised due to the invalid function.
Validation:
  To ensure robustness, it's critical that the 'mark_no_op' function is capable to handle non-function objects correctly and signal an error when an attempt is made to mark them as no-op.
