- Scenario 1: Testing the leave_Arg_equal function for a node that is an instance of the Arg Class
  Details:
    TestName: test_leave_Arg_equal_with_valid_node
    Description: The test is intended to verify if the leave_Arg_equal function performs as expected when an instance of Arg class is passed as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the Arg class with valid parameters.
    Act: Invoke the leave_Arg_equal function, passing the instance of Arg class as an argument.
    Assert: Test passes if no exception is thrown and the function completes execution successfully.
  Validation:
    Ensuring that the function works with an Arg instance is critical to ensure appropriate behavior with expected input, as this is integral to the function's specification.

- Scenario 2: Testing the leave_Arg_equal function for a node that is not an instance of the Arg Class
  Details:
    TestName: test_leave_Arg_equal_with_invalid_node
    Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the leave_Arg_equal function when a non-Arg instance is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a class other than Arg with valid parameters.
    Act: Invoke the leave_Arg_equal function, passing the instance of the non-Arg class as an argument.
    Assert: As the method expected an Arg object, there should likely be an error or the function will execute without doing anything, depending on the implementation. The outcome will depend on how the leave_Arg_equal function is defined to handle such cases.
  Validation:
    Testing this scenario is important to check how well the function handles unexpected input, thus testing its robustness.

- Scenario 3: Testing the leave_Arg_equal function when passed None
  Details:
    TestName: test_leave_Arg_equal_with_None
    Description: This test checks how the function behaves when None is passed as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this test.
    Act: Invoke the leave_Arg_equal function, passing None as the argument.
    Assert: As the method expected an Arg object, there should likely be an error or the function will execute without doing anything, depending on the implementation of leave_Arg_equal.
  Validation: 
    Testing this scenario is important as it checks how the function handles None, enhancing our understanding of its behavior under erroneous or unexpected conditions. This is essential in ensuring overall robustness of the function.
