The missing function visit_Add() isn't provided. However, assuming it performs addition operation between two numbers, below are a few test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Validate adding of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_positive_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the visit_Add function can successfully add two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive numbers.
  Act: Call the visit_Add function, passing the two positive numbers.
  Assert: Validate that the output is the correct sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the basic functionality of our method. It ensures correct results are derived even when used with conventional input values â€“ positive numbers.

Scenario 2: Validate adding of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the visit_Add function can correctly add two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative numbers.
  Act: Call the visit_Add function, passing the two negative numbers.
  Assert: Validate that the output is the correct sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This scenario tests if visit_Add can handle and correctly process negative values, hence expanding the comprehensiveness of our tests.

Scenario 3: Validate adding of a positive and a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_add_positive_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the visit_Add function can accurately add a positive and a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive number and a negative number.
  Act: Call the visit_Add function, passing the positive and negative numbers.
  Assert: Validate that the output is the correct sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  It is crucial to test this scenario as it helps to ensure the method's accuracy in conditions where inputs include both positive and negative numbers.

Scenario 4: Validate adding of floating number
Details:
  TestName: test_add_floating_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the visit_Add function can accurately add two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the visit_Add function, passing the two floating-point numbers.
  Assert: Validate that the output is the correct sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This tests visit_Add's capability to process and return correct results for floating point number inputs.

Scenario 5: Validate adding of a number and a zero
Details:
  TestName: test_add_zero
  Description: To verify if the function visit_add can accurately add a number and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a number and a zero.
  Act: Call the visit_Add function, passing the number and zero.
  Assert: Validate the output is equal to the number(non-zero).
Validation:
  This is an edge case, as adding zero technically should not change the value of the other number, validating it ensures that our method follows this fundamental mathematical rule.
