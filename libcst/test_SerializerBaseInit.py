Scenario 1: Initialization with empty comment
Details:
  TestName: test_initialization_with_empty_comment
  Description: The test verifies that the __init__ function correctly initializes the 'comment' attribute with an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class using an empty string as the argument.
  Act: Retrieve the 'comment' attribute from the class instance.
  Assert: Check that the 'comment' attribute is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the __init__ function can handle an empty string as the argument, and assigns it accordingly to the object's attribute, maintaining the object's state integrity.

Scenario 2: Initialization with a non-empty comment
Details:
  TestName: test_initialization_with_non_empty_comment
  Description: The test verifies that the __init__ method correctly initializes the 'comment' attribute with a given non-empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class with a non-empty string as the 'comment' argument.
  Act: Retrieve the 'comment' attribute from the object.
  Assert: Verify that the 'comment' attribute matches the non-empty string used during the initialization.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the __init__ method not only assigns the argument to the attribute, but also that it maintains the assigned state as-is, even if a non-empty string is used.

Scenario 3: Initialization with various data types
Details:
  TestName: test_initialization_with_various_data_types
  Description: The test verifies that the __init__ method raises a type error when initialized with arguments of an incorrect type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of various data types, excluding strings.
  Act: For each data type in the list, attempt to initialize a class instance using an argument of that type.
  Assert: Check that a Type Error is raised every time.
Validation:
  The test confirms that the __init__ method correctly enforces type constraints, ensuring only strings are accepted for the 'comment' argument. This preserves the consistency and integrity of the object's state.
