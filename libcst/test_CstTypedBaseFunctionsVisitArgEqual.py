Scenario 1: Verify the correct behavior of visit_Arg_equal function when called 
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Arg_equal_function_call
  Description: This test is intended to verify the business logic, when the visit_Arg_equal function is called. It ensures no operations or exceptions occur during function execution.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of type Arg.
  Act: Call the function, passing the initialized Arg object as the parameter.
  Assert: There are no return value or operations, ensure no exceptions are raised during the function execution.
Validation:
  This test checks whether the function behaves as expected when executed. It ensures the function can handle an Arg type parameter without raising exceptions, confirming its stability and reliability.

Scenario 2: Evaluate function behavior with different types of input objects
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Arg_equal_with_various_objects
  Description: To check if any exception is raised when objects of different types are passed to the visit_Arg_equal function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize objects of types different from Arg.
  Act: Call the function, passing these objects as the parameter.
  Assert: Ensure no exceptions are raised during the function execution.
Validation:
  This test is of great importance to ensure the robustness of the function. Despite expecting an object of type Arg, the function should handle inputs of other types without breaking or raising an exception.

Scenario 3: Validate function behavior passing None as an argument
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Arg_equal_with_none
  Description: To assess whether the function can handle None values without raising an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: No preparation is needed as we are directly passing None as an argument.
  Act: Call the visit_Arg_equal function, passing None as the parameter.
  Assert: Ensure that no exceptions are raised.
Validation:
  This test is critical to ensure that the function is robust and can handle None values without breaking, a common scenario in dynamic languages like Python.

Note: Scenario 2 and 3 are performance-related scenarios that aim to ascertain the general performance of the function with different or None types which are not explicitly defined as per the function declaration.
