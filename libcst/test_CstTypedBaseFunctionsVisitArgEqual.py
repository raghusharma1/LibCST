Based on the given imports and function definition, here are the sample test scenarios:

```
Scenario 1: Test when the function visit_Arg_equal encounters a MaybeSentinel.
Details:
  TestName: test_Arg_equal_with_maybe_sentinel
  Description: The test verifies whether the function behaves as expected when it encounters an instance of the MaybeSentinel class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of MaybeSentinel.
  Act: Invoke the function visit_Arg_equal with the MaybeSentinel instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected outcome.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test is important as it is essential to validate how the function handles a MaybeSentinel instance since it is a potential input parameter type.

Scenario 2: Test when the function visit_Arg_equal encounters a FlattenSentinel.
Details:
  TestName: test_Arg_equal_with_flatten_sentinel
  Description: The test verifies whether the function behaves as expected when it encounters an instance of the FlattenSentinel class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of FlattenSentinel.
  Act: Invoke the function visit_Arg_equal with the FlattenSentinel instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected outcome.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test ensures that the program behaves as expected when a FlattenSentinel instance is provided as an input. It checks if the function recognizes and handles the FlattenSentinel instance correctly.

Scenario 3: Test when the function visit_Arg_equal encounters a RemovalSentinel.
Details:
  TestName: test_Arg_equal_with_removal_sentinel
  Description: This test is designed to verify how the function performs when confronted with an instance of the RemovalSentinel class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of RemovalSentinel.
  Act: Invoke the function visit_Arg_equal with the RemovalSentinel instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected outcome.
Validation:
  Rationale: Ensuring the app's functionality when dealing with a RemovalSentinel instance is crucial for stability and usability. This test assesses this aspect of the function.

Scenario 4: Test when the function visit_Arg_equal encounters a BaseExpression.
Details:
  TestName: test_Arg_equal_with_base_expression
  Description: The test will validate the function's performance when a BaseExpression instance is provided as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of BaseExpression.
  Act: Call the function visit_Arg_equal using the BaseExpression instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Analyze whether the function produces the anticipated outcome.
Validation:
  Rationale: It's critical to ensure that the function can appropriately handle a BaseExpression instance as a parameter.
