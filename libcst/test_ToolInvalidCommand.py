```
Scenario 1: Test the method with an undefined process name and no command arguments
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_command_no_proc_and_no_arg
  Description: Tests whether the _invalid_command() function executes as expected when called with no process name and no command arguments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure sys.stderr buffer is clear for the test run.
  Act: Invoke _invalid_command() with an empty string for proc_name and an empty list for command_args.
  Assert: Check that the print statement writes the correct output to sys.stderr and that the function returns 1.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensuring the function behaves as expected even when no meaningful input is provided.

Scenario 2: Test the method with a defined process name but no command arguments
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_command_with_proc_no_arg
  Description: The test verifies whether the function runs correctly when a process name is given but command arguments are still missing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set sys.stderr to start in a known clear state for accurate testing.
  Act: Invoke _invalid_command(), passing a process name ("TestProc") but no command arguments (empty list).
  Assert: Verify that the correct output is printed on sys.stderr and that the function returns 1.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function behaves as expected when the process name is provided but command arguments are not, maintaining the business requirements of the function.

Scenario 3: Test the method with both a process name and command arguments
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_command_with_proc_and_arg
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the _invalid_command() function when it is provided with both a process name and command arguments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Guarantee that sys.stderr begins in a known state, free of previous data.
  Act: Call _invalid_command() with a process name ("TestProc") and a few command arguments (["arg1", "arg2"]).
  Assert: Confirm that the required output is printed on sys.stderr and that the function returns 1, irrespective of the input.
Validation:
  By validating that the function's behavior remains consistent even when different inputs are provided, this test provides assurance that it meets its specified requirements.
