Given the function definition is not provided, below assumptions are implied.

Assume the `_invalid_command` looks something like:
```python
def _invalid_command(cmd: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    This function takes in a command as a string, checks if system support this command 
    if supported returns (False, '')
    if not supported returns (True, 'Command not supported.')
    """
```

**Scenario 1: Command is valid**

Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_command_with_valid_command
  Description: This test case aims to validate the function's response when fed with a valid command.
Execution:
  Arrange: Nothing to arrange in this scenario as no objects are required.
  Act: The function `_invalid_command` will be invoked with a valid command such as 'ls' (in Unix/Linux).
  Assert: The expected outcome would be `(False, '')`.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This is important to ensure that the function properly recognizes valid system commands, performs the check correctly.

**Scenario 2: Command is invalid**

Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_command_with_invalid_command
  Description: This test case is to check the function's behavior when provided with an invalid command.
Execution:
  Arrange: Nothing to arrange in this scenario as no objects are required.
  Act: The function `_invalid_command` will be invoked with an invalid command, for example 'not_a_command'.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be `(True, 'Command not supported.')`.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This is important to ensure that function correctly identifies the invalid commands, thereby making sure that system safety is not compromised by mistakenly executing wrong commands.

**Scenario 3: Command is empty**

Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_command_with_empty_command
  Description: This test case checks how the function handles empty commands.
Execution:
  Arrange: Nothing to arrange in this scenario.
  Act: The function `_invalid_command` will be invoked with an empty command string, i.e., ''.
  Assert: The function should treat an empty command as an invalid command. Therefore, the expected outcome would be `(True, 'Command not supported.')`.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This is important to ensure that function correctly handles edge cases such as empty strings. It prevents errors being raised when an empty string is passed unintentionally or intentionally.

Below assumptions are made, based on the actual function implementation, scenarios may vary. Please replace with appropriate ones accordingly.
