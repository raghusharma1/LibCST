Based on the provided data, there seems to be a discrepancy as the primary function "_print_tree_impl" has not been provided. Without the primary function content, creating test scenarios is not feasible. To write test scenarios, we need details about the function's parameters, return type, expected behavior, and error conditions, which don't appear to be provided here.

Please provide the necessary information and the function "_print_tree_impl" for the detailed and correct guidance on creating test scenarios.
