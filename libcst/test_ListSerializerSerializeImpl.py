Without the `serialize_impl` function provided for reference, it's complicated to give specific test scenarios. But, I can give a general view of scenarios you should consider while testing any function.

Scenario 1: Testing the Function with Valid Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_serialize_impl_with_valid_inputs
  Description: This test confirms whether the _serialize_impl function correctly processes valid inputs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the required valid inputs
  Act: Call _serialize_impl with prepared valid inputs
  Assert: Check that the function returns the expected results.
Validation:
  This test is vital to ensure the primary functionality of the serialize_impl function against expected inputs.

Scenario 2: Testing the Function with Invalid Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_serialize_impl_with_invalid_inputs
  Description: This test verifies how the _serialize_impl function handles invalid/erroneous inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare invalid or inappropriate inputs.
  Act: Call _serialize_impl with these prepared inputs.
  Assert: Check whether the function returns an appropriate error or handles the errors gracefully.
Validation:
  This test assures the robustness of the function against unexpected inputs or exceptions.

Scenario 3: Test for Side Effects
Details:
  TestName: test_serialize_impl_for_side_effects
  Description: To check whether calling _serialize_impl manipulates global or external variables that it should not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare any external or global objects and the valid inputs.
  Act: Call _serialize_impl
  Assert: Check the state of those objects to ensure they were not altered.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function also respects the principles of functional programming & does not create undesirable side effects.

Scenario 4: Performance Testing
Details:
  TestName: test_serialize_impl_performance
  Description: To ensure the function performs its operations within acceptable timeframes when receiving large data sets or complex input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large data set or complex parameters for input.
  Act: Call _serialize_impl with these inputs.
  Assert: Time the execution and assert it to be within acceptable performance bounds.
Validation:
  This scenario helps ensure the function stays efficient and scales well with larger/denser input data sets.

Scenario 5: Test idempotence
Details:
  TestName: test_serialize_impl_idempotence
  Description: Ensure that the function behaves consistently when called multiple times with the same input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare valid inputs.
  Act: Call _serialize_impl multiple times with the same inputs.
  Assert: Compare each result to ensure they are identical.
Validation:
  This scenario would validate if the function behaves consistently when called multiple times with the same input.

Remember, these are high-level scenarios and might need adjustments according to the actual implementation of the _serialize_impl function.
