The defined function seems incomplete. There are some hints in your request, such as "boolean", "filterfalse", "Any", "Mapping", "Type", "TypeVar", and "dataclasses", but the actual function "__getstate__" isn't defined in the provided code. As a result, the test scenarios can't be accurately defined. However, considering typical behavior of "__getstate__" and associated modules, here are general scenarios one could consider:

```
Scenario 1: Basic test on __getstate__ to check if it returns correct state dictionary
Details:
  TestName: test_getstate
  Description: Verifying the basic business logic where we check if function is implemented correctly and returns the correct dictionary representing the state of the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a test object of the class containing __getstate__ method.
  Act: Invoke __getstate__ method on the object.
  Assert: Compare the returned state dictionary with the expected one.
Validation:
  We need this test to ensure that function correctly records the state of the object which can be later reused to reconstruct or copy the object.

Scenario 2: Check if __getstate__ ignores fields to be excluded
Details:
  TestName: test_getstate_exclude_fields
  Description: __getstate__ should ignore fields which are marked to be excluded. This test checks this feature.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a test object of the class containing __getstate__ method with some fields marked excluded.
  Act: Invoke __getstate__ method on the object.
  Assert: Ensure that the resultant dictionary does not contain excluded fields.
Validation:
  We test this to ensure that the function correctly excludes undesired field from the state. Excluding fields is necessary when we want to skip certain fields during serialization or copying of object.

Scenario 3: Check for any exceptions raised by __getstate__
Details:
  TestName: test_getstate_exception_handling
  Description: If there are issues with creating a state dictionary, __getstate__ method should raise appropriate exceptions. Test this logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a corrupted or bad object with impossible state.
  Act: Invoke __getstate__ method.
  Assert: Check if the expected exception is raised.
Validation:
  We need to ensure that the function fails safely and predictably when errors occur. Exception handling is important for understanding the type of errors that may occur during the execution.

Given more information about expected behavior of the "__getstate__" function, more specific tests can be designed.
