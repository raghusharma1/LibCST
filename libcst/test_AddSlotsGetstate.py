```
Scenario 1: Validate behavior when all fields in the object have a corresponding attribute.
Details:
  TestName: test_all_fields_have_corresponding_attribute
  Description: This test will validate the function when all fields in the object have a corresponding attribute. We assume there is no attribute error being raised.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a data class object with some fields and make sure that each field has a corresponding attribute.
  Act: Call the `__getstate__` function with the created object.
  Assert: The function should return a Mapping with field names mapped to their respective attribute values.
Validation:
  Contributing to our confidence in the function's resilient handling of normal input data scenarios, this test ensures that all attributes of a data object can be retrieved and correctly mapped with their field names.

Scenario 2: Validate behavior when the object contains fields without a corresponding attribute.
Details:
  TestName: test_fields_without_corresponding_attribute
  Description: This test will validate that the function correctly ignores any field that doesn't have a corresponding attribute in the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a data class object with several fields. Remove or don't set attributes for a few of them.
  Act: Call the `__getstate__` function with this object.
  Assert: The function should return a Mapping only with fields that had a corresponding attribute in the object.
Validation:
  This test assures the robustness of the function in uncommon or unexpected data scenarios, ensuring it correctly distinguishes fields with attributes and doesn't cause attribute errors.

Scenario 3: Check the returned Mapping for correctness
Details:
  TestName: test_mapping_correctness
  Description: This test intends to validate that the Mapping returned by the function correctly maps object field names to their respective attribute values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a data class object with certain fields and matching attributes.
  Act: Call the `__getstate__` function and get the resulting Mapping.
  Assert: Validate that all keys in the Mapping match the field names and their values correspond to the attributes of those fields in the object.
Validation:
  It's essential to certify that the method returns correctly structured and valid data, as it plays a part in moderating the business logic. It bolsters the assurance in the data structural consistency provided by our function.
