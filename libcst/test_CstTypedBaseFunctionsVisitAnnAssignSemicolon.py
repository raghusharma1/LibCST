```
Scenario 1: Test if the visit_AnnAssign_semicolon method can handle an AnnAssign node
Details:
  TestName: test_pass_AnnAssign_node
  Description: This test case aims to verify if the method visit_AnnAssign_semicolon can take an AnnAssign node and handle it without any error or exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: An AnnAssign node object is created.
  Act: The function visit_AnnAssign_semicolon is invoked, passing the created AnnAssign node object as argument.
  Assert: No exception or error is expected occuring from the execution of the function.
Validation:
  This is crucial because the function visit_AnnAssign_semicolon is designed to handle an AnnAssign node. If it fails in handling such an object, then it's a fundamental bug in this function.

Scenario 2: Test if the visit_AnnAssign_semicolon method is idempotent
Details:
  TestName: test_method_idempotent
  Description: This test case is designed to check whether the multiple executions of the method visit_AnnAssign_semicolon, using the same AnnAssign node object, consistently return the same result without changing the argument object's state.
Execution:
  Arrange: An AnnAssign node object is created.
  Act: The function visit_AnnAssign_semicolon is invoked multiple times with the same AnnAssign node object.
  Assert: No exception or error is expected occuring from the execution of the function, and the state of the AnnAssign node object remains the same after each function execution.
Validation:
  As the method visit_AnnAssign_semicolon is primarily for code transformation and its execution should not affect the state of the passed AnnAssign node object. Ensuring its idempotence guarantees that the function can be invoked as many times as needed without unexpected changes in its behavior and state.

Scenario 3: Test if the visit_AnnAssign_semicolon method can handle None input
Details:
  TestName: test_method_handle_none
  Description: This test case aims to verify if the method visit_AnnAssign_semicolon can handle None input without crashing. 
Execution:
  Arrange: None input is prepared.
  Act: Invoke the function visit_AnnAssign_semicolon with None as argument.
  Assert: Expect that the function would complete its execution without exception or error.
Validation:
  As a well-designed method, visit_AnnAssign_semicolon should be resilient to None input and handle it gracefully without crashing the system. This type of test is important as it confirms robustness of the system.
