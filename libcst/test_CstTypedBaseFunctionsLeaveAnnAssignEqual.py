```python
Scenario 1: Default Execution of leave_AnnAssign_equal Function
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_AnnAssign_equal_default_execution
  Description: This test is intended to verify the default execution of the leave_AnnAssign_equal function. Since the method implementation consists of a pass statement, this test is going to explore whether the function executes successfully when invoked without causing any runtime errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an 'AnnAssign' object from libcst, name it 'test_node'.
  Act: Call the function 'leave_AnnAssign_equal' on the 'test_node'.
  Assert: There is no exception thrown during the function call.
Validation:
  This is a basic sanity check that ensures the pass method can be called on an instance of "AnnAssign". 

Scenario 2: Function Execution With Various "AnnAssign" Instances
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_AnnAssign_equal_with_various_nodes
  Description: This test validates the ability of the leave_AnnAssign_equal function to handle various instances of the "AnnAssign" class. Here, we need to make sure that all variations of "AnnAssign" objects are handled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate various 'AnnAssign' objects with different configurations and store them in a list.
  Act: Loop through the list and call 'leave_AnnAssign_equal' on each instance.
  Assert: No exception is thrown during the function calls.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's compatibility with all possible instances of the "AnnAssign" class and validates the function's robustness and adaptability.
  
Scenario 3: Execution With Non "AnnAssign" Instances
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_AnnAssign_equal_with_non_AnnAssign_instances
  Description: This test is intended to verify the leave_AnnAssign_equal function's behavior when it is invoked with non "AnnAssign" instances. Since Python is dynamically typed, it is essential to ensure that the function behaves as expected when called with a wrong object instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate several non-'AnnAssign' objects, such as 'Assign', 'BaseStatement', 'FunctionDef', etc., and store them in a list.
  Act: Loop through the list and call 'leave_AnnAssign_equal' on each instance.
  Assert: An exception should be thrown during the function calls, or the function should handle the instances without failing. The exact behavior depends on the impact and specifications of such scenarios.
Validation:
  This test helps confirm the function's robustness in case it is accidentally called with incorrect parameters. It would be crucial for error handling and input validation. The assertion will depend on the specifications and desired behavior of the function in such scenarios.
