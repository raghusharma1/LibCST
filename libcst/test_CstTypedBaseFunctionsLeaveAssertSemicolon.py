ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=leave_Assert_semicolon_71d630e15e


Scenario 1: Verify that function can be invoked with a correct assert statement
Details:
  TestName: test_assert_invocation
  Description: This test aims to verify that the function leave_Assert_semicolon can be invoked without errors given a correct assert statement as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: An assert statement node will be instantiated.
  Act: The function leave_Assert_semicolon will be invoked with the assert statement node as argument.
  Assert: The function invocation won't produce any exceptions.
Validation:
  This test guarantees that leave_Assert_semicolon method can be invoked with a correct assert statement as input, confirming its ability to process these input types.

Scenario 2: Verify no return value for the function leave_Assert_semicolon
Details:
  TestName: test_assert_no_return
  Description: This test aims to verify whether the function leave_Assert_semicolon returns anything or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an Assert node.
  Act: The function leave_Assert_semicolon will be invoked with the assert statement node as argument.
  Assert: The function will not return any value.
Validation:
  This scenario will confirm the adherence of the function to its definition which states no return value, thus adhering to its intended programming structure.

Scenario 3: Verify the function invocation with 'None' value
Details:
  TestName: test_assert_none_argument
  Description: This test aims to verify the function behavior when invoked with 'None' value.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: The function leave_Assert_semicolon will be invoked with 'None' as an argument
  Assert: The function invocation won't produce any exceptions.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function is robust and can handle None values without errors, which is crucial for a stable system.

Scenario 4: Verify the function invocation with incorrect data type
Details:
  TestName: test_assert_incorrect_data_type
  Description: This test aim to verify the function's behavior when invoked with an incorrect argument type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a non-assert instance node
  Act: Invoke the function leave_Assert_semicolon with a non-assert instance as an argument
  Assert: The function will raise a type error
Validation:
  This test helps to ensure that leave_Assert_semicolon function only processes valid inputs according to its specification and raises exceptions for inputs that it cannot process.
