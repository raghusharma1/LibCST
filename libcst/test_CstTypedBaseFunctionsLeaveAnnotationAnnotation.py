Scenario 1: Leave Annotation No-Op Functionality
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_annotation_no_op
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function leave_Annotation_annotation is behaving as a no-op function. This function should not alter the "Annotation" node provided to it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a dummy "Annotation" node that will be passed to the leave_Annotation_annotation function.
  Act: Invoke the leave_Annotation_annotation function with the dummy "Annotation" node.
  Assert: Check if the returned node is the same as the one passed, meaning no operation was performed on it.
Validation:
  The result is important to verify if function leave_Annotation_annotation's purpose is to do nothing on the Annotation tree node, reflecting the expected behavior according to the business logic.

Scenario 2: Ensure No Return Value
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_annotation_no_return_value
  Description: This test is to ensure that the function leave_Annotation_annotation is not returning any value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a dummy "Annotation" node to be passed to the leave_Annotation_annotation function.
  Act: Invoke the leave_Annotation_annotation function with the dummy "Annotation" node and capture the return value.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is None.
Validation:
  This test is essential as return values might indicate changes made in the function, which is against the principles that leave_Annotation_annotation function should follow. As per business logic, any alterations in the function would be undesirable.

Scenario 3: Check compatibility with various "Annotation" node types
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_annotation_node_compatibility.
  Description: To verify if the function leave_Annotation_annotation is compatible and doesn't throw an exception on being passed different types of "Annotation" nodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple different dummy "Annotation" nodes to pass to the function leave_Annotation_annotation.
  Act: Invoke the leave_Annotation_annotation function sequentially with all the different "Annotation" nodes created.
  Assert: Check if none of the function invocations threw an exception.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function behave correctly with various "Annotation" nodes as per the business rules input, and doesn't lead to unexpected exceptions.
