Scenario 1: Verifying the Object Type of Node Passed to Function
Details:
  TestName: test_arg_value_node_type
  Description: The test aims to confirm that when an object of the libcst.Arg type is passed to the function, it does not raise any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the libcst.Arg type with appropriate parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function with the Arg type object as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that no exceptions or errors occurred during the execution.
Validation:
  It is crucial to ascertain that the visit_Arg_value function accepts the specified inputs without raising any exceptions as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Verifying the Function Has No Side Effects
Details:
  TesName: test_arg_value_no_side_affects
  Description: Verifying that the function visit_Arg_value does not modify the input node of libcst.Arg type. As the function currently does not have any executable statements, it is important to ensure future changes do not introduce any side effects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of type Arg, save a copy of it for reference.
  Act: Pass the Arg object to the function visit_Arg_value.
  Assert: Verify that the input Arg object has not been modified by comparing it to the saved copy.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the function does not modify its inputs is fundamental to its specified behavior, reinforcing confidence in its lack of side effects.

Scenario 3: Ensuring the Function Returns None
Details:
  TestName: test_arg_value_return_none
  Description: Checking that a call to the function visit_Arg_value with a libcst.Arg node as an argument returns None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a libcst.Arg object.
  Act: Invoke the function visit_Arg_value using the initialized Arg object.
  Assert: Check if the function returned None.
Validation:
  As per the function's definition, it should not return any values (return is None by default). This test validates this behavior and ensures expected functional specifications are met.
