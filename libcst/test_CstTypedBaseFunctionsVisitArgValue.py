Apologies for the confusion, but there's no function `visit_Arg_value` provided in your question. Please provide the function details for me to formulate the test scenarios. Here's a general structure of how the test scenarios might be formulated for a hypothetical `visit_Arg_value`:

```python
def visit_Arg_value(arg1: Type1, arg2: Type2, arg3: Type3) -> ReturnType:
    # function logic goes here
```

Here's how the test scenarios might look:

```text
Scenario 1: Verify the function with valid non-edge case inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_non_edge_case
  Description: In this test, we will pass valid input to the function to ensure the business logic is returning the expected output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `arg1, arg2 and arg3` with valid non-edge case data for these arguments.
  Act: Invoke `visit_Arg_value(arg1, arg2, arg3)`
  Assert: The function should return the expected output.
Validation:
  If the input is correct, the function should be able to process it successfully and return the correct value. This verifies the main functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Verify the function with edge case inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case
  Description: In this test, we will pass edge case input to function and ensure it is handling it correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `arg1, arg2 and arg3` with edge case data for these arguments.
  Act: Invoke `visit_Arg_value(arg1, arg2, arg3)`
  Assert: The function should handle this input gracefully and return the expected output for these edge cases.
Validation:
  This test ensures that all edge cases are handled properly without causing any errors or unexpected output.

Scenario 3: Verify the function with invalid inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_input
  Description: In this test, we will pass invalid input to the function. It should be able to handle these gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `arg1, arg2 and arg3` with invalid data for these arguments.
  Act: Invoke `visit_Arg_value(arg1, arg2, arg3)`
  Assert: The function should raise an exception or return an error message indicating that the input is not valid.
Validation:
  This test ensures that invalid input is being flagged as so, preventing the propagation of improper values and maintaining data integrity.
```

Without the body of the function, I can't provide you with more specific test scenarios. But I hope this gives an idea on how to approach testing.
