Scenario 1: Verification of code generation consistency
Details:
  TestName: test_codegen_graceful_fail_on_lambda
  Description: This test verifies that improper lambdas won't allow code generation, which is a mechanism to ensure the correctness of code generation.
Execution:
  Arrange: A model object using `parse_module` initialized with a lambda function string where its arguments are improperly set.
  Act: Call the `code` property of the initialized model object.
  Assert: An exception of type `CodegenPartial` should be thrown.
Validation:
  It is essential to maintain the consistency and correctness of code generation. It catches any discrepancy if present and ensures the quality of code generation.

Scenario 2: Verification of error message output
Details:
  TestName: test_fstring_with_template_exp
  Description: This test verifies that a template expression in an f-string would deliver an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string having template expression in an f-string.
  Act: Pass the initialized string to the `parse_expression` function.
  Assert: An exception of type `PartialParserSyntaxError` should be thrown with a specific error message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the proper error message is delivered when a template expression is encountered within an f-string, which guides the user about the potential mistake.

Scenario 3: Verification of line continuation parsing
Details:
  TestName: test_line_continuation_multiline_string
  Description: This test verifies if line continuation on a multiline string is parsed properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string set with line continuation on it.
  Act: Pass the initialized string to the `parse_module` function.
  Assert: The returned result should have a specific structure which corresponds to the correct parsing of the line continuation in the string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that line continuation on multiline strings is parsed properly, which is crucial for correctly interpreting the code.

Scenario 4: Verification of token conversion
Details:
  TestName: test_tokenize_with_tabs
  Description: This test verifies if tokens are correctly output when the input contains tabs.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string is initialized containing tabs, and a tokenizer.
  Act: Pass the initialized string to the `tokenize` function of the tokenizer.
  Assert: The returned result should contain tokens where tabs are converted to spaces.
Validation:
  This test ensures that tabs are correctly converted into spaces, which is crucial for preserving the code's visual structure while still maintaining language semantics.

Scenario 5: Verification of tokenizer with comments
Details:
  TestName: test_tokenize_with_comments
  Description: This test verifies if the tokenizer properly handles comments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a string containing comments and a tokenizer.
  Act: Pass the initialized string to the `tokenize` function of the tokenizer.
  Assert: The returned result should correctly identify and handle comments.
Validation:
  This test validates the tokenizer's ability to correctly identify and handle comments in the code, which is important for accurately parsing the code.
