Apologies for the confusion, but the provided method is not entirely visible to provide a comprehensive set of test scenarios. But based on partial available information, I will suggest a general approach which can be refined further.

Consider following the test scenario's template for the partially visible `exec_transform_with_prettyprint` and `gather_files` functions, which seem to be some of the several methods from `libcst.codemod` library.

```text
Scenario 1: Test execution transformation with pretty printing
Details:
  TestName: test_exec_transform_with_prettyprint_functionality
  Description: This test checks if the 'exec_transform_with_prettyprint' function is performing transformation and pretty printing the result as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate arguments needed for the function, which would be a codemod object, python code as text and an object to hold the context.
  Act: Invoke exec_transform_with_prettyprint function with above parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned code is correctly transformed and pretty printed according to the applied codemod.
Validation:
  This test is vital in ensuring the basic functionality of code transformation and its pretty printing is working correctly. This forms the primary feature of the method.

Scenario 2: Test file gathering
Details:
  TestName: test_file_gathering_functionality
  Description: Test if the 'gather_files' function successfully gathers all files provided a valid python module path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a valid python module or directory path.
  Act: Invoke 'gather_files' function with the prepared path.
  Assert: Validate if the function is returning correct files present under the provided path.
Validation:
  This is important to ensure that the function is accurately gathering python files given a valid path. It verifies that path parsing and file retrieval mechanism is working as expected, which is essential for subsequent operations on these files.
```

Please note that you would also need to design edge test cases for these methods - scenarios where the functions may fail or could be misused and how they are supposed to handle such situations. This may include providing empty directory paths or file paths that do not exist, or trying to transform non-python code.
