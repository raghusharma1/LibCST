The provided code does not include a function named `leave_And_whitespace_before`. I see only import statements from multiple modules including `libcst` and `typing`. Without specific function definitions, I cannot propose any test scenarios as instructed. Please provide the function `leave_And_whitespace_before` implementation, then I will be able to assist you better. 

If you need help testing those imported functions or classes, please clarify this and specify which of these imports I should design the test scenarios for.

I am unable to write the pytest as there is no method provided to me in the task. The task instruction ends with "The method you need to create the unit test cases for is provided below:" and then the method or function is not provided. Please provide a method for which I can write the unit tests.
