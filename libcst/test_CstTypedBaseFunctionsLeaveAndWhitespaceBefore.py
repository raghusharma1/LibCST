Scenario 1: Checking the Function Behaviour with 'And' Node
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_And_whitespace_before_with_node
  Description: This test verifies that the leave_And_whitespace_before function accepts an "And" node as an argument and does not raise any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an "And" node object.
  Act: Call the leave_And_whitespace_before function, passing the "And" node as an argument.
  Assert: Check that no exceptions are raised.
Validation:
  As the function is supposed to handle "And" nodes without raising errors, this test validates that the function works correctly when provided a valid "And" node object.

Scenario 2: Checking the Function Behaviour with Empty Input
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_And_whitespace_before_without_node
  Description: This test verifies that the leave_And_whitespace_before function can handle an empty input, in this case, a None value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a None value to use as input.
  Act: Call the leave_And_whitespace_before function, passing None as an argument.
  Assert: Check that the function does not raise any exceptions.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function can gracefully handle unexpected input and would validate the function's error handling capability.

Scenario 3: Checking the Function Behaviour with Different Node Class
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_And_whitespace_before_with_different_class_node
  Description: This test verifies that the leave_And_whitespace_before function behaves correctly when provided with node classes other than "And".
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a node object of a different class, i.e., "Or" node.
  Act: Call the leave_And_whitespace_before function, passing the "Or" node as an argument.
  Assert: Check that no exceptions are raised.
Validation:
  The function should correctly handle any node class that it might encounter in a real-world scenario, so this test validates that it can do so.

Note: As the function currently does not return any values or modify its arguments, the scope of testing mainly involves checking that it does not raise exceptions and works as expected under different scenarios.
