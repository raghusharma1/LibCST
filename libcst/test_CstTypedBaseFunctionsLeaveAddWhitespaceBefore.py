As the function definition is not provided, I'll assume a generic function named `leave_Add_whitespace_before`, and we'll write some examples based on that:

```python
def leave_Add_whitespace_before(input: str) -> str:
    """
    A function that adds a whitespace character before each sentence in a string.
    """
    return ' '.join(input.split('.'))
```

Here are some example test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Test function adds whitespace before sentences
Details:
  TestName: test_whitespace_before_sentences
  Description: This test is intended to verify that a whitespace character is added correctly before each sentence in a string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a string with multiple sentences.
  Act: Pass this string as the parameter to the function.
  Assert: The returned string should have a whitespace character before each sentence.
Validation:
  This test checks the main functionality of the function. If it fails, it's a sign that something crucial is broken. The expected result aligns with the function's purpose to add whitespace before each sentence.

Scenario 2: Test function handles single sentence correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_single_sentence
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles a string containing only one sentence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a string containing a single sentence.
  Act: Pass this string into the function.
  Assert: The returned string should be identical to the input string as there is no other sentence to add whitespace before.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks a potential edge case for the function. The correct handling of a single sentence input demonstrates that the function is robust even in unconventional scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test function handles empty string
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_string
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles the scenario where the input is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty string.
  Act: Pass this string into the function.
  Assert: The returned string should be an empty string. There's no sentence in the string to add whitespace before.
Validation:
  This test validates the function behavior for the scenario when it receives an empty string. It tests the function's robustness in handling diverse input scenarios. 

Scenario 4: Test Function with Special Characters
Details:
  TestName: test_special_character_handling
  Description: This test aims to verify how the function responds when special characters are present in the string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a string having multiple sentences containing special characters.
  Act: Pass this string to the function.
  Assert: The function should return a string with whitespaces before every sentence, ignoring the special characters.
Validation: 
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly ignore special characters and continue to function as expected. This is critical as input strings could contain a variety of special characters.
