```
Scenario 1: Callable Object's Result is Undefined
Details:
  TestName: test_callable_result_undefined
  Description: This test is intended to see how the __call__ method behaves when it's intended return value is undefined. In such a case, the __call__ method should run the callable itself and then return's the callable's return value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an instance of the class, passing in a callable that returns a certain value. Initialize the return_value attribute to _UNDEFINED_DEFAULT.
  Act: Invoke the __call__ method of the class with no arguments.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the same as the callable's return value.
Validation:
  It's important for the __call__ method to correctly operate with a callable that has an undefined return value, to prevent incorrect results, ensure reliable operations, and adhere to function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Callable Object's Result is Defined
Details:
  TestName: test_callable_result_defined
  Description: This test aims to verify that the __call__ method will correctly return the defined return value of the class instance. In this case, the callable itself should not be invoked again, ensuring memoization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an instance of the class, passing a callable. The return_value attribute should be explicitly set.
  Act: Call the __call__ method of the class instance.
  Assert: The returned value should match the defined return_value, and not the callable result.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms that memoization works correctly, and the function does not needlessly recompute and invoke the callable again once the result is already known, which would enhance the efficiency.

Scenario 3: Callable Result Matches the Return Value
Details:
  TestName: test_callable_result_matches_return_value
  Description: This test case aims to validate the case when the callable's result matches the return_value of the class instance, even though it was initially undefined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an object instance passing a callable. The return_value should be initialized to _UNDEFINED_DEFAULT.
  Act: Call the __call__ method of the class instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the callable's return value, subsequently the return_value should also match the callable's return value.
Validation:
  It's critical to ensure that the __call__ method correctly updates the return_value if initially undefined, ensuring future invocations don't need to recalculate the result.
