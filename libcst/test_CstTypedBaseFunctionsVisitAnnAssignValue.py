The function definition of `visit_AnnAssign_value` is missing from the question. However, from the information given, it can be deduced that the function is written to work with the LibCST library (a Python Concrete Syntax Tree (CST)) for parsing, analyzing, and modiying the Python code.

Based on this, some potential scenarios are developed below without diving into deeper specifics. 

Scenario 1: Testing for correct parsing and conversion of an annotated assignment statement
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_AnnAssign_value_Parsing
  Description: Verify the correct parsing, conversion, and storing of an annotated assignment statement in the CST.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an annotated assignment statement to feed into the function.
  Act: Feed the prepared statement to the function `visit_AnnAssign_value`.
  Assert: Check that the parsed and converted CST representation of the statement matches the expected output.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly translates Python code into a readable and manipulable form for the CST. As the first step of analysis, this must be correct for further tests to be valid and useful.

Scenario 2: Testing function behavior with function calls within an annotated assignment statement
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_AnnAssign_value_WithFunctions
  Description: Assure that function calls within annotated assignment statements are correctly handled and stored.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a statement with a function call, like `a:int = functioncall()`, for the test.
  Act: Run the `visit_AnnAssign_value` function with the prepared statement.
  Assert: Confirm that CST reflects the function call accurately and the parsed output matches the expected result.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Annotated assignments with function calls are a common element of Python code, so testing for this assures that the function can handle real-world use cases.

Scenario 3: Testing function behavior with complex variable types
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_AnnAssign_value_ComplexTypes
  Description: Test to verify whether the function handles complex variable types, like nested lists or dictionaries, correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an annotated assignment statement which uses complex variable types, such as `a: List[Dict[str, int]] = [{"key": 1}, {"key": 2}]`.
  Act: Invoke `visit_AnnAssign_value` function with the prepared statement.
  Assert: Make sure the CST built from the function reflects the complex variable types accurately.
Validation:
  Rationalize: In real-world cases, annotated assignments will not always deal with simple data types. It is thus necessary to test that `visit_AnnAssign_value` can handle and correctly parse complex types.
