Scenario 1: Validate method leave_AnnAssign_semicolon when invoked without parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_AnnAssign_semicolon_no_param
  Description: This test investigates whether the leave_AnnAssign_semicolon method behaves as expected when invoked without parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a mock AnnAssign object node.
  Act: Invoke the leave_AnnAssign_semicolon method without passing any parameters.
  Assert: Ensure that the method doesn't return any values or modify the state of the application.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the method doesn't modify any state or return any value when invoked without parameters, matching the current behavior of the function intended by the developer. This ensures we adhere to the principle of least surprise for other developers who might not expect actions from a seemingly passive method.

Scenario 2: Validate method leave_AnnAssign_semicolon with "AnnAssign" node parameter
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_AnnAssign_semicolon_with_param
  Description: This test aims to investigate the behavior of the leave_AnnAssign_semicolon method when invoked with an "AnnAssign" node parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a mock "AnnAssign" node object.
  Act: Invoke the leave_AnnAssign_semicolon method and pass the mock "AnnAssign" node as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function doesn't modify the mock "AnnAssign" node and doesn't throw any exception.
Validation:
  The test validates that the method correctly handles parameters of type "AnnAssign" without errors and doesn't return any values or alter the node's state. This behavior is consistent with the intended functionality of the function and helps us understand how the function works with an "AnnAssign" node.

Scenario 3: Validate method leave_AnnAssign_semicolon when called multiple times
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_AnnAssign_semicolon_multiple_calls
  Description: This test is designed to assess the function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon under stress when called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a mock "AnnAssign" node object.
  Act: Invoke the leave_AnnAssign_semicolon method multiple times, passing the mock "AnnAssign" node each time.
  Assert: Verify that the method doesn't modify the mock "AnnAssign" node and doesn't throw any exception, no matter how many times itâ€™s invoked.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the function can handle being called multiple times in a row without any issues, such as memory leaks or state changes. This confirms the method's robustness and its suitability for use in larger programs with high-volume function calls.
