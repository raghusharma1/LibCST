Scenario 1: Test for default behavior of function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon
Details:
  TestName: test_function_default_behavior
  Description: This test case is aimed to check the default behavior of the function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function and the appropriate parameters for the function.
  Act: Call the function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon without providing any optional parameters. 
  Assert: Test the return value of the function to be as expected.
Validation:
  The check is vital as this will validate if the functionâ€™s expected default behavior (occurs when no parameters are passed) is working correctly per the program's logic and requirements. 

Scenario 2: Test function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon with MaybeSentinel param
Details:
  TestName: test_function_with_maybe_sentinel
  Description: This test case is aimed to check the behavior of the function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon when the parameter MaybeSentinel is used.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function and the MaybeSentinel parameter.
  Act: Call the function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon with MaybeSentinel as a parameter.
  Assert: Test the return value of the function to be as expected when using the MaybeSentinel parameter.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks whether the function correctly handles the MaybeSentinel argument, and if it does so, the expected business functionality is being fulfilled.

Scenario 3: Test function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon with RemovalSentinel param
Details:
  TestName: test_function_with_removal_sentinel
  Description: This test scenario is intended to verify the behaviour of the leave_AnnAssign_semicolon function when the RemovalSentinel parameter is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function and the RemovalSentinel parameter.
  Act: Call the function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon with RemovalSentinel as a parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the function's return value is as expected when using RemovalSentinel as a parameter.
Validation:
  This particular test checks if the function properly handles the RemovalSentinel parameter. Meeting expectations here would signify the function's requirements and business needs are being met.

Scenario 4: Check behavior of leave_AnnAssign_semicolon for each class of nodes
Details:
  TestName: test_each_class_of_nodes
  Description: This testcase intends to verify how the function behaves for each class of nodes. Each class would act as a different scenario/instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function and each type of node.
  Act: Call the function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon with each node type, one at a time.
  Assert: Test if the function's return value is as expected for each of the different node types.
Validation:
  This will validate if the function can handle all types of nodes it is supposed to work with, thus ensuring it's functioning as per the design and business requirement. 

Scenario 5: Test the function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon with Union types
Details:
  TestName: test_union_types
  Description: This testcase intends to validate the behaviour of the function when we provide Union types as the parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function and Union types.
  Act: Call the function leave_AnnAssign_semicolon with Union types as a parameter.
  Assert: Verify the return value of the function to be as expected when using Union types.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it will ensure whether the function can properly handle Union types and maintain the correct functional and business requirements.
