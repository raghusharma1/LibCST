Scenario 1: Test when an instance of AnnAssign is passed
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_AnnAssign_annotation_with_instance
  Description: This test is intended to verify that when an instance of AnnAssign is passed to the function, the function processes without raising any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an AnnAssign instance.
  Act: Invoke the leave_AnnAssign_annotation() function with the AnnAssign instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function does not raise any exceptions.
Validation:
  The importance of the test is to ensure that the function behaves as expected when an instance of type AnnAssign is passed as a parameter.

Scenario 2: Test when the argument is not an instance of AnnAssign
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_AnnAssign_annotation_with_wrong_type
  Description: This test is to verify that when the function is invoked with an argument, which is not of type AnnAssign, there are no exceptions or errors raised.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a variable of a type other than AnnAssign.
  Act: TCall the leave_AnnAssign_annotation() function with this variable.
  Assert: Check that there are no exceptions raised.
Validation:
  Since leave_AnnAssign_annotation() function should only work with variables of type AnnAssign, it is essential to see if the function handles other data types without raising any exceptions.

Scenario 3: Test when no arguments are passed to the function
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_AnnAssign_annotation_with_no_args
  Description: This test is to verify the function's behavior when no argument is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required in this case.
  Act: Call the leave_AnnAssign_annotation() function without passing any arguments.
  Assert: Check to assert that a TypeError is raised since the function is expecting one required positional argument.
Validation:
  The functionality of leave_AnnAssign_annotation() function is highly dependent on the passed argument and this test thus helps confirm if the function is capable of handling situations where the required argument is missing.

Scenario 4: Test that the function does not return a value
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_AnnAssign_annotation_return
  Description: This test is to verify that the function does not return a value since its defined return type is None in its signature.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of AnnAssign.
  Act: Call the leave_AnnAssign_annotation() function with the AnnAssign instance and capture the return value.
  Assert: Verify that the captured return value is NoneType.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function respects its signature, hence returning the correct return type.
