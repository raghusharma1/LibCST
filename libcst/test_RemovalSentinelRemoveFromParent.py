```
Scenario 1: Validating successful return of function RemoveFromParent
Details:
  TestName: test_remove_from_parent_success
  Description: This test is aimed to validate the successful running of the function RemoveFromParent, and ensuring it returns the correct enum value for proper parent-child node interaction.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for invoking this function as it does not rely on initialized objects or particular environment variables.
  Act: Invoke the function RemoveFromParent.
  Assert: Check the returned object, and expect it to equal RemovalSentinel.REMOVE.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function RemoveFromParent operates successfully. If passed, it confirms that the function is indeed returning the expected enum value, indicating correct removal of a node in larger tree structures.

Scenario 2: Repeat execution of RemoveFromParent
Details:
  TestName: test_remove_from_parent_repeated
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the function RemoveFromParent returns consistent results over multiple invocations, ensuring consistent behavior in iterative or large-scale node manipulations.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function RemoveFromParent several times.
  Assert: Check the returned object for every invocation, and expect them all to be RemovalSentinel.REMOVE.
Validation:
  As this function is fundamental in parent-child tree structure manipulations, in scenarios of iterative or multiple removals, this test will demonstrate the consistency and reliability of the function's output. If passed, it signifies that RemoveFromParent is behaving as expected and can reliably be used for use-cases requiring repeated removals.

Scenario 3: Usage of RemoveFromParent within other higher-level methods
Details:
  TestName: test_remove_from_parent_in_method
  Description: This test aims to validate that the function RemoveFromParent's return value is appropriately utilized within another method or function in the context of parent tree node manipulation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a higher-level function or method utilizing RemoveFromParent for the purpose of node removal.
  Act: Invoke the higher-level function or method.
  Assert: Verify that the usage of RemoveFromParent leads to the correct removal behavior within the context of parent-child tree structures.
Validation:
  In real-world scenarios, RemoveFromParent would take action within a higher-level method - such as 'leave_Arg'. This test verifies that within such scenarios, the method performs accurately - providing practical validation to its design and implementation. If passed, it confirms the function's effectiveness and its realtime usability.
