Please note that the question seems incomplete. It only contains the import statement, but the definition of RemoveFromParent function is not provided. 

However, I can provide a general guide on how to write test scenarios for a Python function using pytest. Let's consider the function RemoveFromParent to be designed for removing a child node from a parent node in a tree data structure. 

```python
def RemoveFromParent(parent, child):
    if child in parent.children:
        parent.children.remove(child)
        child.parent = None
    else:
        raise ValueError("Child does not belong to the specified parent")
```

Scenario 1: Testing the successful removal of a child node from a parent node.
```
Details:
  TestName: test_remove_from_parent_success
  Description: This test verifies if a child node is successfully removed from the list of parent's children.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a parent node with a list of children, including the child to be removed.
  Act: Invoke RemoveFromParent(parent, child).
  Assert: Check if the child is not in parent.children and child.parent is None.
Validation:
  It is necessary to ensure the child node is removed correctly and the reference to the parent is set to None. This is directly related to the core function of RemoveFromParent.
```

Scenario 2: Testing the removal of a node that is not a child to the specified parent.
```
Details:
  TestName: test_remove_from_parent_failure
  Description: This test checks if a ValueError is raised when trying to remove a node that is not child to the specified parent.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a parent node with children that does not include the child intended to be removed.
  Act: Invoke RemoveFromParent(parent, child) and expect a ValueError.
  Assert: The ValueError should be raised with an appropriate message.
Validation:
  The function needs to handle this erroneous input correctly, as per its specifications. This will prevent illegal operations in the parent and child node relationship. 
  ```
This approach ensures all essential behaviours of the function are being tested and validated. Ensure to cover all the possible input scenarios and expected outcomes. Every function might have different requirements and behaviours, and all these should be considered while designing the test scenarios.
