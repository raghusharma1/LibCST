The provided information does not contain clear function or method that needs to be tested. The text consists of only a list of imports which seems to be incomplete or added by mistake. For writing test scenarios, a clear understanding of the function or method signature and its behavior is required. This includes what the method or function is supposed to do, what parameters it takes, what possible return types are, and how it handles errors or exceptions.

I would request you to provide the method or function details that needs to be tested. This might include not just the function name and signature but also what the function is accomplishing. Some important points might include: 

- What are the function's inputs? Are there any constraints on these inputs?
- What does the function return?
- Are there side effects to the function call?
- Is the function deterministic? E.g. if called with the same input twice, will it return the same output?
- How should errors or exceptions be managed? What happens on invalid input?
  
Without such context, it isn't feasible to provide correct test scenarios or guidelines for the pytest implementation.

I'm sorry but the provided context seems to be unrelated and incomplete. There is no mention about a clear function or method that needs to be written a unit test for. 

The method, "get_inherited_dependencies" you are referring to in the import instructions is not clearly defined or explained as to what is does, its parameters, return value etc.

In order to accurately write pytest unit tests, the function or methods implementation details are required:

- What the function is trying to achieve (its purpose)
- The parameters of the function
- The return value of the function
- Any exceptions or errors the function might raise
- Any side effects (like changing global state, changing the parameters, writing to a file, etc)

If you provide these details then I will be able to assist you further. Please provide the clear function/method details so that I can help accordingly.
