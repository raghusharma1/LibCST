Scenario 1: Test if function correctly handles when no assertion is passed
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Assert_no_msg_passed
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function visit_Assert_msg correctly performs no operation when no assertion message is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a mock Assert node with no message (empty Assert).
  Act: Call visit_Assert_msg function with the mock node as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that no exceptions are raised and no operation is performed.
Validation:
  Importance: Ensuring that the visit_Assert_msg function correctly handles no assertion message is crucial to avoiding unexpected errors or results during runtime.

Scenario 2: Test if function correctly handles when an assertion is passed
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Assert_msg_passed
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function visit_Assert_msg correctly performs no operation when an assertion message is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a mock Assert node with a dummy message.
  Act: Call visit_Assert_msg function with the mock node as the parameter. 
  Assert: Check that no exceptions are raised and no operation is performed.
Validation:
  Importance: The test is important to ensure that the visit_Assert_msg function handles the presence of an assertion message by correctly performing no operation.

Scenario 3: Test if function correctly handles non-assert nodes
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Assert_non_assert_node
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function visit_Assert_msg correctly performs no operation when a non-assert node is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a mock non-Assert (e.g., a Call node) node.
  Act: Call visit_Assert_msg function with this mock non-Assert node as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that no exceptions are raised and no operation is performed.
Validation:
  Importance: The test is important to ensure that the visit_Assert_msg function does not fail and correctly performs no operation when a non-assert node is passed.

Scenario 4: Testing with a null node.
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Assert_null_node
  Description: This test verifies if the function can handle a scenario where a null node is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: No preliminary arrangement is required as we will be passing None.
  Act: Call visit_Assert_msg function passing None as the argument.
  Assert: Check that no exceptions are raised and no operation is performed.
Validation:
  Importance: This test verifies that the function safely handles null inputs without leading to a null pointer exception.
