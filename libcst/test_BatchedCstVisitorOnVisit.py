Scenario 1: Verifying behavior when a visitor provider sets valid metadata on different code constructs
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_metadata_setting
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the visitor provider correctly associates the defined metadata with different node types (such as modules, classes, functions, etc) in the abstract syntax tree.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a custom VisitorMetadataProvider that sets specific metadata on all nodes it visits.
  Act: Parse a Python code snippet using parse_module and pass the resulting module to the custom visitor provider.
  Assert: Ensure that the metadata associated with each node is as expected.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the visitor provider functions correctly when setting metadata. This ensures the reliability of any further analyses or transformations based on this metadata.

Scenario 2: Ensuring self-metadata dependency is handled correctly
Details:
   TestName: test_self_metadata_dependency
   Description: A test to verify that the metadata provider can correctly provide self metadata.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a provider that sets metadata and immediately retrieves it.
  Act: Visit the tree using the Visitor.
  Assert: Ensure the retrieved metadata equals the set metadata.
Validation:
  This important test verifies that self-dependency metadata retrieval is reliably handled, an essential feature needed to correlate code constructs with their metadata.

Scenario 3: Ensuring an exception is raised for accessing unset metadata
Details:
  TestName: test_access_unset_metadata
  Description: A test to verify that accessing unset metadata raises a KeyError.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a provider that does not set any metadata and a visitor that tries to access this metadata.
  Act: Visit the tree using the Visitor.
  Assert: Verify that KeyError is raised.
Validation:
  Testing error conditions is as important as successful conditions as it ensures graceful failures and provides clear debugging information. 

Scenario 4: Validate that deep clone generates a correct and independent copy
Details:
  TestName: test_deep_clone
  Description: This will check if the deep clone function generates a proper copy of the visited nodes, ensuring no references are shared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Visitor that collects node IDs during on_visit invocations.
  Act: Generate a deep clone and compare the IDs of the original and cloned nodes.
  Assert: There should be no shared identifiers between the original and cloned nodes.
Validation:
  This confirms the independence and accuracy of deep_clone operation, a standard functionality required for most immutable data structures.

Scenario 5: Validate node visit counting and prevention of node duplication
Details:
  TestName: test_node_visit_count
  Description: This will verify that each node is visited exactly once, and no nodes are duplicated during the visiting.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CountVisitor that counts node visit frequency.
  Act: Visit the tree using the CountVisitor.
  Assert: Every Node ID should have a count of one, which verifies that each node is visited exactly once.
Validation:
  This verifies the correctness of node visitation process during the metadata setting phase, ensuring no redundancy or omission occurs.
  
Note: Actual test code would involve specific Python code snippets, the parsing of which results in the CSTNodes these test scenarios are interested in.
