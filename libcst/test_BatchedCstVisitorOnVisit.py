Scenario 1: Test the function when the `before_visit` property is not None
Details:
  TestName: test_on_visit_before_visit_is_not_none
  Description: The test aims to verify the function on_visit when the `before_visit` parameter is not None.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the parent object using the required visitor methods would be established, along with a node. The before_visit parameter would be set to a function that modifies a global variable, for instance.
  Act: The on_visit function would be invoked with this node.
  Assert: The global variable is modified, proving that the function referenced in before_visit was run. 
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function defined in before_visit is appropriately executed when the on_visit function runs, making sure that the business logic of applying operations before visiting a node gets executed properly.

Scenario 2: Test that visit methods associated with the node type are called
Details:
  TestName: test_on_visit_calling_visit_methods
  Description: This test verifies that the appropriate visit methods for the given node type are being called when the function on_visit is executed.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the parent object would be created that's using visitor methods associated with a certain node type. Each visit method could modify a global variable to prove it ran.
  Act: The on_visit function would be invoked with a node of the matching type.
  Assert: The global variable was modified in a way that shows all appropriate visit methods were run.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the correct visit methods associated with a node's type are being called when the on_visit function is executed. This is crucial for the correct execution of business logic associated with a particular node type.

Scenario 3: Test that the on_visit function always returns True
Details:
  TestName: test_on_visit_return_true
  Description: This test is to verify that the on_visit function is always returning True, irrespective of its internal execution.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the parent object would be created, along with a node.
  Act: The on_visit function would be invoked with this node.
  Assert: The result of the function should be True.
Validation:
  As per the business logic defined in the function on_visit, it should always return True. This test ensures that the standard functionality of this function remains the same no matter the state of the process, reinforcing its stability and reliability.
