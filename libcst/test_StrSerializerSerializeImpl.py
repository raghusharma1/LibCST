I'm afraid it's quite challenging to provide a complete and precise set of test scenarios without having the actual _serialize_impl function definition at hand. Still, let's consider a hypothetical implementation of _serialize_impl and based on it, attempt to outline a set of testing scenarios.

The _serialize_impl function could look like this:

```python
def _serialize_impl(input_data: Dict):
    """
    Function to serialize input data into a YAML format.
    Input:
    - input_data (Dict): a dictionary to be serialized.
    Returns:
    - output_data (str): a string representing the serialized YAML.
    """
    output_data = yaml.dump(input_data)
    return output_data
```

Based on this hypothetical business logic, here are a number of test scenarios:


Scenario 1: Testing empty input dictionary
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_dict
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function handles an empty dictionary as the input data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty dictionary.
  Act: Invoke the function with the empty dictionary as parameter.
  Assert: The output should be an empty string.
Validation:
  The importance of this test lies in ensuring that the function handles edge cases properly. An empty dictionary is a valid input and hence the function should return a corresponding appropriate output - an empty string in this case.

Scenario 2: Testing non-empty dictionary
Details:
  TestName: test_non_empty_dict
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function is accurately serializing a non-empty dictionary into a YAML formatted string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a non-empty dictionary.
  Act: Invoke the function with the non-empty dictionary.
  Assert: Check if the output string, when deserialized, equals the original input dictionary.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is accurately serializing the input data into YAML format. The expected result is closely connected to the function's specification and highlights one of the core functionalities of the _serialize_impl function.

Scenario 3: Testing with complex dictionary objects
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_dict
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function is accurately serializing complex dictionary objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a complex dictionary. e.g.Dictionary containing another dictionary or list as one of the values.
  Act: Invoke the function with the complex dictionary.
  Assert: Check if the output string, when deserialized, equals the original input dictionary.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that _serialize_impl can handle complex dictionary structures correctly. Its success ensures that the function's implementation adheres to the YAMLrelated specifications of supporting serialization of complex objects.
