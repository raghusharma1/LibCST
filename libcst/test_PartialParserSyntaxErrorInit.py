Scenario 1: Check Successful TokenType Processing by get_full_name_for_node
Details:
  TestName: test_get_full_name_for_token_type
  Description: Test for checking whether the function "get_full_name_for_node" correctly processes the TokenType in the 'node' parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of 'TokenType' will be defined.
  Act: The function 'get_full_name_for_node' will be invoked by using the 'TokenType' instance as the parameter.
  Assert: The returned string will be checked against the full name of the supplied token type.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function can process the 'TokenType' correctly, which is crucial for generating accurate identifiers for tokens during parsing.

Scenario 2: Functionality of get_full_name_for_node For Any Invalid Type
Details:
  TestName: test_get_full_name_for_invalid_type
  Description: This scenario tests whether the function 'get_full_name_for_node' raises an appropriate exception when an invalid type is supplied.
Execution:
  Arrange: A non-PythonTokenTypes will be initialized.
  Act: The function 'get_full_name_for_node' will be called with the invalid type as the parameter.
  Assert: The function is expected to raise a ValueError exceptions.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function handles invalid node types correctly which is useful for preventing unexpected behaviors and maintaining the robustness of the parsing process.

Scenario 3: Check Successful ReservedString Processing by get_full_name_for_node
Details:
  TestName: test_get_full_name_for_reserved_string
  Description: This test intent is to verify whether the function "get_full_name_for_node" correctly handles ReservedString types.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of 'ReservedString' will be created.
  Act: The function 'get_full_name_for_node' will be invoked with the ReservedString instance as the parameter.
  Assert: The returned string will be verified to match the value of the supplied reserved string.
Validation:
  This tests that the function is capable of correctly processing ReservedString types which is essential for accurate parsing of reserved keywords.

Scenario 4: Check Successful Sequence Processing by get_full_name_for_node
Details:
  TestName: test_get_full_name_for_sequence
  Description: This scenario intends to test if the function "get_full_name_for_node" can process Sequences correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: A sequence of multiple 'TokenType' instances will be defined.
  Act: The 'get_full_name_for_node' function will be invoked with the sequence as the parameter.
  Assert: The resulting string will be checked against the expected value.
Validation:
  The test case validates that the function can generate a correct representation for sequences of types.
