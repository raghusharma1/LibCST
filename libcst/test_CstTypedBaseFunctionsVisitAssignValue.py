Scenario 1: Function Execution without Passed-in Argument
Details:
  TestName: test_no_input_arg_execution
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when it's called without passing any argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameter.
  Act: Call the function `visit_Assign_value` without passing any argument.
  Assert: Since the function is expected to handle its execution even without any passed-in argument, no exception should be raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle its execution even when no passed-in argument is provided which is essential to ensure robustness.

Scenario 2: Function Execution with Passed-in Argument as Assign Instance
Details:
  TestName: test_execution_with_assign_instance
  Description: This test verifies whether the function properly processes the passed-in argument in the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an `Assign` object from the libcst._nodes.statement module.
  Act: Invoke the function `visit_Assign_value` with the Assign object instance passed as a parameter.
  Assert: The function is expected to process without raising any exception due to the presence of a correct argument.
Validation:
  This test checks whether the function correctly processes input data meeting the required specification.

Scenario 3: Function Execution with an unexpected Type of Passed-in Argument
Details:
  TestName: test_execution_with_unexpected_type_arg
  Description: This test is intended to demonstrate how the function visit_Assign_value behaves when unpredictable input, that is not of type `Assign`, is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a variable with an instance of another object from libcst._nodes.statement module that is not `Assign`.
  Act: Invoke the function with this instance passed as a parameter.
  Assert: Since the function is expected to be resilient to incorrect data types, no exception should be raised.
Validation:
  This scenario is important to ensure the robustness of the function and to ascertain the function's ability to handle undesired types of input data.
