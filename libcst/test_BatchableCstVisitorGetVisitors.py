Without the full details of what `get_visitors` method does, test scenarios are slightly speculative. Here are some high-level test scenarios assuming the function has to do with visiting nodes in a syntax tree (based on the `libcst` library usage):

```
Scenario 1: Verify the function navigates through the tree correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_get_visitors_returns_expected_node_list
  Description: This test verifies that get_visitors navigates through the tree and returns the expected list of child nodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a CSTNode instance with known child nodes.
  Act: Invoke the get_visitors function on the node instance.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list of nodes matches the expected list.
Validation:
  The expected result verifies that the get_visitors function works as expected by correctly navigating through the tree and returning the right child nodes. If it fails, the users may not get expected results when trying to visit nodes in a tree.

Scenario 2: Verify the function returns an empty iterable for leaf nodes 
Details:
  TestName: test_get_visitors_returns_empty_for_leaf_nodes
  Description: This test verifies that get_visitors returns an empty iterable when called on a leaf node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a leaf CSTNode instance.
  Act: Invoke the get_visitors function on the node instance.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned is an empty iterable.
Validation:
  The correctness of get_visitors in returning empty iterable for leaf nodes is paramount as it is a key determinant of when the traversal stops. Failure to do this might lead to infinite loops.

Scenario 3: Verify the function raises an appropriate exception when supplied with a bad input
Details:
  TestName: test_get_visitors_raises_correct_exception
  Description: This test verifies that get_visitors raises the correct type of exception when supplied with an inappropriate input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Call get_visitors with a non CSTNode input.
  Act: Catch any exception thrown and assert its type.
  Assert: Confirm that the raised exception is the expected one.
Validation:
  Throwing expected exceptions when provided with bad inputs is a good indication of a robust method. It should fail loudly and signal to the user what went wrong to have it fixed.
```

Remember, these are guesses as to what `get_visitors` does based on the context. Actual tests might be different based on the accurate functionality of the method.
