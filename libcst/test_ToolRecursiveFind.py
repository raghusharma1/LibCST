```
Scenario 1: Testing Function with Correct Directory and Module Name
Details:
  TestName: test_recursive_find_valid_case
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies and lists all python modules in the specified directory and its subdirectories.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a directory structure that includes python (.py) files and subdirectories. Additionally, some files that are not python files may also be included to validate the behavior.
  Act: Invoke the function "_recursive_find" passing a valid directory path and a base module name. The directory path refers to the directory prepared earlier. 
  Assert: Verify the output of the function. It should return a list of tuples representing all the python modules and corresponding module names in the directory structure. 
Validation:
  This test case verifies that the function behaves as expected when called with valid parameters and it is important to ensure the correct operation of the system.

Scenario 2: Testing Function with Incorrect Directory or Base Module Name
Details:
  TestName: test_recursive_find_invalid_case
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles incorrect directory paths or base module names correctly, and does not crash.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement is necessary in this case.
  Act: Invoke the function "_recursive_find" passing an invalid directory path or base module name. 
  Assert: The function should handle this case gracefully.
Validation:
  This test case is critical as it ensures graceful failure of the function when given incorrect inputs. The function is not expected to throw an exception or crash, and this test case helps confirm that.

Scenario 3: Testing Function with Directory Containing Large Number of Files  
Details:
  TestName: test_recursive_find_performance
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function performs well and within acceptable time limits when dealing with directories that contain a large number of files and subdirectories.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a directory structure that includes a substantial number of python (.py) files and subdirectories.
  Act: Invoke the function "_recursive_find" passing the directory path and a base module name. 
  Assert: Monitor the execution time of the function. It should also return a list of tuples representing all the python modules.
Validation:
  This test case evaluates the performance of the function and as such, it plays a vital role in ensuring that the function is capable of handling real-life scenarios where a directory could contain large number of files.
```
You may need to adjust the specific threshold values and the exact arrangements depending on the known or expected limitations of the function. Also, always remember that although these scenarios do not focus on input types, any testing strategy should also consider input validation tests.
