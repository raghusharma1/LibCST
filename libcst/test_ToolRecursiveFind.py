The provided information contributes to confusion as it isn't omitting a clear function to be tested out named `_recursive_find`. The code consists mostly of imports without a suggestive function testing context. Please, be sure to provide a complete and clear context. However, here are some generic test scenarios for a notional `_recursive_find` function.

```
Scenario 1: Function returns correct result with valid recursive data
Details:
  TestName: test_recursive_find_valid_data
  Description: The test evaluates the correct functionality of _recursive_find when presented with valid recursive data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a nested data structure, like a recursive list or dictionary.
  Act: Call _recursive_find with this data structure and a 'target' that is known to exist within it.
  Assert: The function should return the expected result.
Validation:
  This test enables validation of the core functionality of _recursive_find which should find and return a specific 'target' item in a recursive structure.

Scenario 2: The 'target' is not present in the recursive data structure
Details:
  TestName: test_recursive_find_target_absent
  Description: The test investigates how _recursive_find handles cases where the 'target' is not part of the recursive data structure.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a recursive data structure.
  Act: Invoke _recursive_find on this data with a 'target' known not to be in the data structure.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a suitable result indicating that the 'target' was not found.
Validation:
  It's crucial to ensure that _recursive_find can handle cases where the 'target' is not found without failing, as this will be a common use case.

Scenario 3: Function performance on large data structures
Details:
  TestName: test_recursive_find_large_data
  Description: This test verifies how _recursive_find performs when applied on extremely large, recursive data structures.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a very large recursive data structure.
  Act: Run _recursive_find with this data structure and a 'target'.
  Assert: Check whether the function can handle the large data within a reasonable timeframe.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that _recursive_find is robust and scalable enough to handle the recursive structures of any size that it might encounter in production.

Scenario 4: Function is input with non-recursive data
Details:
  TestName: test_recursive_find_non_recursive_data
  Description: Testing how the function handles data that is not recursive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a non-recursive data structure. For example, a simple list or dictionary.
  Act: Call _recursive_find on this data structure with a 'target'.
  Assert: Ensure the function correctly identifies that the structure is not recursive and returns the corresponding output.
Validation:
  _recursive_find should be able to handle different types of input, not just the recursive structures, to provide flexibility and robustness.
```
Note: Correct test scenarios can only be identified when the purpose and functionality of the function are clearly defined. Above guidelines are assumptions based only on naming.
