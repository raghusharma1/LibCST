I'm sorry, but the information provided is not sufficient to write unit tests. You did not provide any specific Python method or class to test. Additionally, some instructions are cut-off and don't seem relevant to the context, like the mention of a "CENSE file". Could you please provide more information or clarify your instructions? Specifically, if you can provide the Python function to be tested, then I'll be able to help you more.
