```
Scenario 1: Verify function calls correct leave attribute method
Details:
  TestName: test_on_leave_attribute_calls_correct_method
  Description: This test ensures the function correctly calls the appropriate leave attribute method on the node after visiting attribute's children.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the visitor_methods with a function f mapped to the key "leave_CSTNode_attribute". Create an instance of CSTNode as the original node, and set attribute name.
  Act: Invoke the on_leave_attribute function with the created CSTNode object and attribute.
  Assert: Confirm the function f has been called with the original node as the argument.
Validation:
  Ensuring on_leave_attribute successfully invokes the appropriate leave attribute method is critical for verifying the function's behavior, as it's supposed to trigger additional processing on the node after visiting its children.


Scenario 2: Verify function gracefully handles absence of relevant method in visitor_methods. 
Details:
  TestName: test_on_leave_attribute_no_method_in_collection
  Description: This test confirms that the function doesn't raise an error when there are no relevant leave attribute methods in visitor_methods.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the visitor_methods with an empty list. Create an instance of CSTNode as the original node, and set attribute name.
  Act: Invoke the on_leave_attribute function with the created CSTNode object and attribute.
  Assert: No exceptions should be raised as a valid but empty function list is a good scenario to verify the robustness of this function.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring the stability of the function by verifying that it gracefully skips the invocation of attribute leave method when none exist in the visitor_methods dictionary.


Scenario 3: Validate function calls multiple leave attribute methods sequentially when multiple are present
Details:
  TestName: test_on_leave_attribute_calls_multiple_methods
  Description: The function should call all relevant leave attribute methods in the order they are listed when more than one is present.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the visitor_methods with two functions, f1 and f2, mapped to the key "leave_CSTNode_attribute". Create an instance of CSTNode as the original node, and set attribute name.
  Act: Invoke the on_leave_attribute function with the created CSTNode object and attribute.
  Assert: Check that both f1 and f2 have been called in order, each with the original node as the argument.
Validation:
  It proves on_leave_attribute ability to handle multiple visitor methods, important both for how the system currently operates and for potential future expansions where multiple visitor methods would need to be executed.
