```
Scenario 1: Test the default method behavior with Annotation node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Annotation_whitespace_before_indicator_default_behavior
  Description: This test is intended to verify the default behavior of the method when a standard Annotation node is provided. Given the function structure, we do not expect any alterations to the node or any output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an example instance of the Annotation node.
  Act: Invoke the function visit_Annotation_whitespace_before_indicator, passing the created Annotation instance as argument.
  Assert: Verify that the function does not raise any exceptions and that the passed Annotation instance remains unaltered.
Validation:
  As the function is currently a no-op and does not implement any business logic, we expect no alterations to occur to the nodes that it processes. This test is, thus, designed to validate this behavior, serving as a base reference point for any future amendments to the method functionality.

Scenario 2: Test the method behavior with different types of nodes
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Annotation_whitespace_before_indicator_with_non_annotation_nodes
  Description: The test intends to verify the function's behavior when a non-Annotation node is provided as an argument. Given Python's dynamic typing, it is possible for any node type to be passed to this function; its reaction to different node types should be consistent with its intended behavior - which is doing nothing in this instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create instances of several different node types.
  Act: Invoke the function with each of these nodes as arguments.
  Assert: Verify that the function does not alter the nodes or raise exceptions during processing.
Validation:
  This test ensures the functionâ€™s compatibility with different node types and helps certify its resilience to diverse inputs. As the function definition currently doesn't include any behavior specifications, we anticipate no action to be undertaken upon passing non-Annotation nodes. 

Scenario 3: Test the function behavior with None node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_annotation_whitespace_before_indicator_with_none
  Description: This test is aimed at determining how the function responds when None is provided as a node. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No preparation is needed.
  Act: Call the visit_Annotation_whitespace_before_indicator function with None as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that no exceptions are raised during the function execution.
Validation:
  Ensuring that a function correctly handles None input is a key aspect of robust software design, especially for functions that can potentially process a wide range of input data types. As the function is primarily a stub with no defined behavior, we expect it handle None input gracefully without raising any exceptions.
