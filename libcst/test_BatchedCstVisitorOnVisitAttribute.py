Without the function body or further context of the function `on_visit_attribute`, it's difficult to provide specific test scenarios. However, here are some assumptions based on the information given:

Typically `on_visit_attribute` could be a method used in a visitor pattern, handling the visit to a certain object's attribute in a tree or graph structure. This can often be seen in projects like AST(Abstract Syntax Trees), CST(Concrete Syntax Trees), HTML DOM trees, XML parsers.

Here are a few hypothetical test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Proper handling of traversal to node attribute
Details:
  TestName: test_node_attribute_traversal
  Description: This test verifies if the method correctly handles the traversal to a node's attribute during tree walking.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the CST object with known nodes and attributes.
  Act: Invoke the `on_visit_attribute` on a particular node's attribute.
  Assert: Check if the function has correctly visited/processed the node's attribute.
Validation:
  It's crucial as it ensures function implementation correctly follows the visitor pattern to process nodes in a CST correctly.

Scenario 2: Handling of non-existent attribute
Details:
  TestName: test_non_existent_attribute
  Description: This is to test the function's behavior when asked to visit a node's attribute which doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the CST object with known nodes.
  Act: Invoke `on_visit_attribute` on a non-existent attribute.
  Assert: Check if the function gracefully handles the situation, i.e., rising the appropriate exception or returning a null object.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure the robustness of our function against potentially erroneous calls.

Scenario 3: Correct Metadata assignment and usage
Details:
  TestName: test_metadata_assignment_and_usage
  Description: To verify if the function correctly assigns and uses metadata during its visit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize metadata and prepare the CST object with known nodes.
  Act: Invoke `on_visit_attribute` on a node's attribute and manipulate metadata.
  Assert: Check if metadata was correctly used and updated based on the operation performed.
Validation:
  It guarantees that function correctly manages its metadata, which might be crucial for proper CST processing.

Scenario 4: Invocation on nested or complex attributes
Details:
  TestName: test_nested_attribute_handling
  Description: Inspect if the function correctly handles traversal to a deeply nested or complicated attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the CST object with known nodes and nested attributes.
  Act: Invoke `on_visit_attribute` on a nested attribute.
  Assert: Check if the function can correctly visit/process the nested attribute.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function implementation can correctly process complex or nested attributes during CST traversal.
