Scenario 1: Testing visit function for a regular Annotation node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Annotation_whitespace_after_indicator_regularNode
  Description: This test attempts to verify if the visit_Annotation_whitespace_after_indicator function operates correctly given a regular annotation node.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class containing the function is created, and a regular annotation node is initiated.
  Act: The test invokes the function with the regular annotation node as a parameter.
  Assert: The function is expected to execute without throwing any exceptions or errors.
Validation:
  This test is significant because it ensures that the function correctly handles regular operation with common input scenarios. It helps to confirm that the basic functionality of the function is correctly implemented.

Scenario 2: Testing visit function with None as the Annotation node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Annotation_whitespace_after_indicator_noneNode
  Description: This test verifies if the function works correctly when None is passed as the annotation node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, No specific annotation node is required as None is passed as a parameter.
  Act: The function is invoked with None as a parameter.
  Assert: The function is expected to execute without throwing any exceptions or errors.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function can handle None values as parameters, which is an important part of exception handling in Python.

Scenario 3: Testing visit function with arbitrary objects as the Annotation node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Annotation_whitespace_after_indicator_arbitraryObject
  Description: This test checks if the function operates correctly when arbitrary objects are passed as the annotation node.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class containing the function, and an arbitrary object is initialized.
  Act: The function is called with an arbitrary object as a parameter.
  Assert: The function is expected to handle the input and execute without causing any errors.
Validation:
  Even though the function is expecting an Annotation node, this test is necessary to ensure that the function has been designed to handle and gracefully manage unexpected parameters. This scenario tests the robustness of the function and its handling of potential errors.

Note: The validation of tests will depend largely on the intended behaviour of the method when it is fully implemented, as currently it contains no logic. These tests should be updated accordingly as the implementation is updated with the actual processing of the annotation's whitespace after the indicator.
