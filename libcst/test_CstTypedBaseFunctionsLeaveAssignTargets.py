Scenario 1: Test leave_Assign_targets with Assign Node
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_assign_targets_with_assign_node
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the leave_Assign_targets function completes its execution without throwing any exception or error when an instance of the Assign node is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the Assign node.
  Act: Invoke the function leave_Assign_targets, passing the Assign node instance.
  Assert: Check that no exceptions or errors are thrown during the function call.
Validation:
  The success of this test ensures that the function can safely process Assign nodes without technical issues. 

Scenario 2: Test leave_Assign_targets with non-Assign Node 
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_assign_targets_with_nonassign_node
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the leave_Assign_targets function returns None when a non-Assign type node is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of any node type other than Assign.
  Act: Invoke the leave_Assign_targets function, passing the node instance.
  Assert: Check that the function returns None.
Validation:
  If the function handles incorrect node types by returning None, this should not create any unforeseen side effects in an application. 

Scenario 3: Test leave_Assign_targets with None 
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_assign_targets_with_none
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the leave_Assign_targets function returns None when called with None rather than a node.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no initialization step in this case.
  Act: Invoke the leave_Assign_targets function with None as a parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns None.
Validation:
  This scenario checks how the function responds to an absence of parameters to ensure that it does not cause any unexpected exceptions or errors. 

Remember, these tests depend on the understanding that the 'leave_Assign_targets' function has no functionality (no logic inside the method and returns None for everything). One should change the test scenarios to accommodate when the function's logic is implemented.
