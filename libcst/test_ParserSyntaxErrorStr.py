Apologies for any misunderstanding but there seems to be no specific function whose test scenarios need to be created. Your instruction contains multiple import statements and a note, but there's no practical Python function to focus on. 

Could you please provide a Python function, with clear inputs and outputs, whose test scenarios you're interested in creating? 

For example, a simple function like:

```python
def add(a, b):
  return a + b
```

For such a function, we can create test scenarios. Without such detail, it's difficult to provide a meaningful response to your request.

I'm sorry, but the task prompt seems to be incomplete or confusing. It does not provide a clear instruction or any function on which I can write pytest unit tests. The content after "Below is the global code mentioned in the class" and "TASK" does not contain any specific Python function, it appears to be a truncated or scrambled sentence.

Please provide a clear and complete Python function for which I need to create unit test cases. Examples of clear information include function parameters, what the function does, expected outputs, and particular edge cases, among others. 

Here's an example of a short and clear task prompt:

""" 
You are given a Python function in a file named data_processing.py:

def multiply(a, b):
    # This function takes two numerical inputs (integer or float) and returns their product.
    return a * b

Please write a Pytest for the function, covering these scenarios:
1. Both inputs are positive integers.
2. Both inputs are negative integers.
3. Both inputs are floats, etc.
"""

Based on such a prompt, I would be able to write the corresponding Pytest unit tests for the provided function.
