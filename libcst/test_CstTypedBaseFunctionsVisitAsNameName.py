ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=visit_AsName_name_d287cdda41


Scenario 1: Test if the function visit_AsName_name works as expected with an AsName Node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_asname_name_with_asname_node
  Description: This test verifies the function visit_AsName_name accepts an AsName node and doesn't raise any exceptions during execution.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AsName node object.
  Act: Execute the visit_AsName_name function with the AsName node object.
  Assert: Check the function doesn't raise any exceptions.
Validation:
  The test validates the function behaves correctly when provided with an AsName node and doesn't cause any unwanted side effects.

Scenario 2: Test if the function visit_AsName_name works as expected with a non-AsName Node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_asname_name_with_non_asname_node
  Description: This test verifies the function visit_AsName_name rejects a non-AsName node and raises a Type Error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-AsName node object (e.g., Name node).
  Act: Execute the visit_AsName_name function with the non-AsName node object.
  Assert: Check the function raises a type error.
Validation:
  The test verifies the function is correctly type guarded and restricts any misuse by accepting only correctly typed inputs (AsName nodes).

Scenario 3: Test if the function visit_AsName_name works as expected when executed multiple times
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_asname_name_with_multiple_executions
  Description: This test verifies the function visit_AsName_name can be executed several times without causing any errors or side effects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple AsName node objects.
  Act: Execute the visit_AsName_name function with each of the AsName node objects in a loop.
  Assert: Check the function doesn't raise an exception during each execution.
Validation:
  The test assures the function can handle multiple executions, demonstrating its reliability and stability.

Scenario 4: Test the function visit_AsName_name with different AsName Nodes
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_asname_name_with_different_asname_nodes
  Description: This test verifies that the function visit_AsName_name works as expected with different types of AsName nodes, including different attribute values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create different AsName node objects (considering variations in attribute values).
  Act: Invoke the visit_AsName_name function with each of the different AsName node objects.
  Assert: Verify the function doesn't raise any exceptions for any of the AsName nodes.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function can handle a variety of AsName nodes, validating its versatility and robustness.
