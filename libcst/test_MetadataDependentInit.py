Scenario 1: Validating proper initialization of the MetadataResolver and metadata is empty.
Details:
  TestName: test_metadataresolver_initialization
  Description: This test is intended to verify that upon the initialization of the MetadataResolver, the attribute metadata is set to an empty dictionary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the MetadataResolver object.
  Act: Check the object's metadata attribute.
  Assert: The metadata attribute should be an empty dictionary.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the MetadataResolver object is properly initialized with correct default values.

Scenario 2: Testing MetadataResolver's add_metadata method.
Details:
  TestName: test_add_metadata
  Description: This test checks that the add_metadata method properly adds metadata to the resolver.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a MetadataResolver instance and a target node for the metadata.
  Act: Use the add_metadata method to add some metadata for the node.
  Assert: Verify that the metadata was added correctly by checking the resolver's metadata attribute.
Validation: 
  Verifying that the add_metadata method functions correctly is vital for the MetadataResolver class to operate as expected, as add_metadata is responsible for associating metadata with given nodes.

Scenario 3: Testing MetadataResolver's set_metadata method.
Details:
  TestName: test_set_metadata
  Description: This test checks that the set_metadata method properly sets metadata to the resolver.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a MetadataResolver instance and a target node for the metadata.
  Act: Use the set_metadata method to add some metadata for the node.
  Assert: Verify that the metadata was set correctly by checking the resolver's metadata attribute.
Validation: 
  Verifying that the set_metadata method functions as expected is crucial as this method is responsible for adding metadata to a specific key for a node in the metadata dictionary. If this feature does not work correctly it would make it impossible to handle metadata properly.

Scenario 4: Testing MetadataResolver's visit method.
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_method
  Description: This test checks that visit method correctly updates the metadata by calling the relevant visit method for node's type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a MetadataResolver instance and a target node.
  Act: Use the visit method on the node.
  Assert: Verify that the correct visit method is invoked and that the metadata is correctly updated.
Validation: 
  This test is important to ensure that the visit method functions correctly as it is instrumental in updating the metadata during the traversal of the syntax tree.

Scenario 5: Test the MetadataResolver handling of nodes with no associated metadata.
Details:
  TestName: test_no_metadata_for_node
  Description: This test verifies that the MetadataResolver still operates correctly even when no metadata is associated with a given node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the MetadataResolver instance and a CST node without any associated metadata.
  Act: Use the set or add metadata function to try adding metadata for the node.
  Assert: Validate that no exceptions are thrown and the resolver's metadata dictionary does not contain any entry for the given node.
Validation:
  In scenarios where some nodes do not have metadata associated with them, it's crucial that the framework still responds robustly and doesn't store unnecessary data. This test verifies this essential behavior.
