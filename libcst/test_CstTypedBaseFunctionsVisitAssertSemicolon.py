1) 
```
Scenario 1: Test that visit_Assert_semicolon does nothing
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Assert_semicolon_nothing_done
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function visit_Assert_semicolon doesn't perform any action.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of "Assert".
  Act: Call the function visit_Assert_semicolon with the created instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the originally created instance of "Assert" remains unchanged after function execution.
Validation:
  As the function does nothing aside from taking an instance of "Assert" as a parameter, the expected result is that the original instance remains unaltered. This will validate the function's idempotency.
```

```
Scenario 2: Test that visit_Assert_semicolon accepts only instances of "Assert"
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Assert_semicolon_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function visit_Assert_semicolon accepts only instances of "Assert" as its parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create instances of "Assert" and another different type, like "If".
  Act: Call the function visit_Assert_semicolon first with the instance of "Assert" and then with the instance of "If".
  Assert: Check if the function call with instance of "Assert" executes without any errors and the function call with the instance of "If" raises a TypeError.
Validation:
  The function visit_Assert_semicolon is designed to take an instance of "Assert". Thus, the check of type of accepted parameters is an essential boundary condition for this function. Ensuring this holds true validates the function's conformance to its parameters specification.
```

```
Scenario 3: Test that visit_Assert_semicolon can handle multiple invocations
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_Assert_semicolon_multiple_invocations
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function visit_Assert_semicolon can handle multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple instances of "Assert".
  Act: Call the function visit_Assert_semicolon in a loop, passing each instance consecutively.
  Assert: Check if the instances of "Assert" remain unchanged after each function execution.
Validation:
  Ensuring that multiple invocations do not affect the outcome is crucial for consistency. This validates the functionâ€™s capability of producing the same output for the same input even with repeated invocation, giving confidence that it's a pure function.
