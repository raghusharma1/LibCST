Scenario 1: Evaluate the representation of normal object
Details:
  TestName: test_repr_for_normal_object
  Description: This test is intended to verify that __repr__ function returns proper string representation of a regular object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of a regular object. 
  Act: Call the __repr__ method on the object instance.
  Assert: Check if string representation returned matches the expected representation.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test checks that __repr__ for a regular object works as expected. If successful, this confirms that __repr__ produces a readable string representation of an object.

Scenario 2: Ensure repr of enumerate objects is effective
Details:
  TestName: test_repr_for_enum_object
  Description: This test is intended to verify that __repr__ function returns proper string representation of an enumeration object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of an enumerated object.
  Act: Call __repr__ on the enumeration object. 
  Assert: Check if returned string matches the expected string representation of enumerated objects' values.
Validation:
  Rationale: Enumeration is an important part of many applications and __repr__ should work well with enumerated objects. This test ensures that __repr__ correctly interprets enumerated objects and returns appropriate result. 

Scenario 3: Validate repr functionality with objects that have their own __repr__ method
Details:
  TestName: test_repr_for_object_with_own_repr
  Description: To ensure __repr__ works correctly for classes that have implemented their own __repr__ method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of object that has its own __repr__ method.
  Act: Call __repr__ function on this object.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the expected representation defined in the class's __repr__ method.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test validates that Python's __repr__ function effectively delegates to the class-defined __repr__ method. Ensuring this behavior is important as it allows classes to define their own human-readable string representation.
