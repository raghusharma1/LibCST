Iâ€™m sorry, but you forgot to provide the business logic encapsulated by the function leave_Annotation_whitespace_before_indicator. To write test scenarios, the details of what the function does is essential. Could you please provide the function implementation?

While this is being prepared, here is a generalized format to be populated when function details are available:

```
Scenario 1: Check when function works with specific values
Details:
  TestName: test_specific_values
  Description: This test verifies if the function correctly performs actions when it is passed specific values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize specific values necessary for the test.
  Act: Call the function with these specific values.
  Assert: Check if the output is as expected when function is performed with specific values.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's response to specific, known values, enhancing our confidence in its ability to process these correctly.

Scenario 2: Check when parameter values are at limit
Details:
  TestName: test_limit_values
  Description: This test checks how the function behaves when it is given limit values. This could be lower limit (like zero for a count) or an upper limit (maximum possible value for a variable in certain context).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize limit values for parameters.
  Act: Call the function with these limit values.
  Assert: Check if output is as expected when dealing with limit values.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles cases at the extremes of the input space.

Scenario 3: Check when function is given an unusual or unexpected scenario
Details:
  TestName: test_unusual_scenario
  Description: This test checks how the function behaves when given an unusual or unexpected scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the unusual scenario.
  Act: Call the function with these unusual conditions.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the unusual scenario correctly.
Validation:
  This test is critical as it guarantees the robustness of the function even in unexpected situations.
  
```
Please note that additional scenarios such as checking for invalid parameters, null values or empty inputs, testing with large data sets, etc. can also be curated once the exact functionality is known.
