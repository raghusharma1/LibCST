```
Scenario 1: Test when the function is called with a valid "Arg" node.
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_arg_whitespace_after_star_with_valid_node
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function runs without throwing any exceptions when it is called with a valid "Arg" node object. This will verify the function's ability to handle valid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: An Arg node should be created with valid inputs, adhering to the design in the libcst._nodes.expression.Arg module.
  Act: The visit_Arg_whitespace_after_star function will be invoked with the created Arg node.
  Assert: The function should run without throwing any exceptions.
Validation: This test verifies that the function operates correctly when the node parameter is valid. If the function passes this test, it indicates it is handling valid input properly.

Scenario 2: Test when the function is called with a None node.
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_arg_whitespace_after_star_with_none_node
  Description: This test validates the visit_Arg_whitespace_after_star method when it is called with None as an argument. This will explore how well the function can handle None values.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no arrangement needed as it doesn't require a node object to be supplied.
  Act: The visit_Arg_whitespace_after_star method will be invoked with None as the argument.
  Assert: An assertion is made to check if the function successfully completes its execution without throwing an error.
Validation: This test case is designed to confirm that the function can handle None and does not throw an error in such cases. This reflects its robustness and reliability in handling such edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test when the function is called with an entirely different node type.
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_arg_whitespace_after_star_with_different_node
  Description: This test is designed to verify whether the function behaves appropriately when it is provided with a completely different node type.
Execution:
  Arrange: An entirely different node that does not belong to Arg nodes (like a Name node, for instance), adhering to the classes in the libcst._nodes.expression module, should be created.
  Act: The visit_Arg_whitespace_after_star method is called, passing the created non-Arg node as an argument.
  Assert: It is confirmed if the function is not throwing any exceptions and hence behaves appropriately.
Validation: Ensuring that the function can handle entirely different nodes without throwing errors is essential to make it robust and avoid crashes. This test verifies the functionâ€™s resilience in processing non-Arg nodes.
