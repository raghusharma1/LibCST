Scenario 1: Test visit_And method without node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_and_without_node
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the visit_And method when it is called without passing a 'node'. The behavior of the method is not defined, so we need to check how it reacts with different input scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A as we need to invoke the method without passing any argument.
  Act: Invoke the function visit_And without any parameter.
  Assert: Check the return of the function should throw an exception or error.
Validation:
  It is important to confirm how the function behaves when not supplied with the required parameters to prevent the application from crashing due to unhandled exceptions in such scenarios.

Scenario 2: Test visit_And method with a valid And node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_and_with_valid_node
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of visit_And with a valid 'And' node as an argument. Since we do not have a defined function behavior, we just need to check if it returns without throwing any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of And node.
  Act: Invoke the function visit_And passing the And node instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function executes without throwing an exception.
Validation:
  The function is expected to work with And nodes. This test validates the function's basic acceptability to handle And node inputs under normal conditions.

Scenario 3: Test visit_And method with an invalid node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_and_with_invalid_node
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of visit_And with an invalid node as an argument. By an invalid node, we mean any other object which is not an instance of 'And'. This is to test the type handling of the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of any other node/object which is not And node.
  Act: Invoke the function visit_And passing the invalid node instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function throws an exception.
Validation:
  This test confirms whether the function properly handles the scenario when it is supplied with a non-And node object.
