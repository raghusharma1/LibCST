```
Scenario 1: Verify the correct 'leave' visitor method is called based on the provided node type
Details:
  TestName: test_appropriate_leave_method_called
  Description: This test verifies the correct 'leave' visitor method is called based on the type of the node provided to the 'on_leave' function. It checks the business logic of associating node types with specific visitor methods.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create several mock visitor methods and associate them with different fictitious node types (e.g., 'leave_NodeTypeA', 'leave_NodeTypeB'). Instantiate the target class with these visitor methods.
  Act: Invoke the 'on_leave' function with a node of each type.
  Assert: Check if the appropriate visitor method for each node type was called.
Validation:
  This test covers the basic operation of the 'on_leave' function and verifies it correctly calls the associated visitor methods based on node type, which is crucial for the function’s expected operation.

Scenario 2: Ensure 'after_leave' method is called if provided
Details:
  TestName: test_after_leave_called
  Description: This test verifies that the 'after_leave' method is invoked if it is provided. It checks the conditional execution of the ‘after_leave’ method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the target class with a mocked 'after_leave' method and a valid visitor method collection.
  Act: Invoke the 'on_leave' function with a sample node.
  Assert: Verify if the 'after_leave' method was called.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's capability to optionally run a method after visiting a node, providing an added hook for custom operations after a node visit.

Scenario 3: Ensure 'on_leave' function's behavior with an empty visitor method collection
Details:
  TestName: test_on_leave_with_empty_visitor_methods
  Description: This test reviews the function's behavior when the visitor method collection is empty, validating the function's robustness in handling edge cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the target class with an empty visitor method collection.
  Act: Call the 'on_leave' function with a sample node.
  Assert: Verify if the function successfully returns without any errors.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can appropriately handle a scenario where there are no visitor methods available, increasing its robustness in handling different scenarios.

Scenario 4: Handle unknown node types with grace in the 'on_leave' function
Details:
  TestName: test_on_leave_with_unknown_node_type
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the node type provided doesn't correspond to any visitor method, reinforcing the function's resilience.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with some visitor methods corresponding to known node types. 
  Act: Invoke the 'on_leave' method with a node of an unknown type.
  Assert: Confirm that the function successfully returns without an error.
Validation:
  This validates that the function can elegantly handle a node type that does not match any visitor method, thereby further bolstering its robustness.
