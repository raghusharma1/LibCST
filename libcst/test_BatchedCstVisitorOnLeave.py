```
Scenario 1: Checking for valid on_leave functionality
Details:
  TestName: test_on_leave_valid_operation
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the on_leave method works properly when valid original_node is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of ProviderA and CSTModule.
  Act: Call the on_leave method with a valid original_node.
  Assert: Assert that no Exception was thrown and the get_metadata method returns true for the original_node.
Validation:
  This test will ensure that the on_leave method correctly executes, proving its reliability when working with valid nodes, which is crucial for the entire function's stability and accuracy.

Scenario 2: Checking on_leave function without setting metadata
Details:
  TestName: test_on_leave_without_setting_metadata
  Description: This test is intended to validate the behavior of the on_leave method when it tries to access not set metadata.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of ProviderA without setting metadata and of CSTModule.
  Act: Call on_leave method with a valid original_node and try to retrieve its metadata.
  Assert: Assert that an Exception is thrown indicating that there is no metadata available for the given node.
Validation:
  This is important to make sure that the on_leave method correctly identifies and handles the situations where the required metadata has not been set. This test will ensure that the function adheres to the desired error-prone functionality.

Scenario 3: Checking on_leave function with different providers
Details:
  TestName: test_on_leave_diff_providers
  Description: This test is designed to verify the functionality of on_leave within different metadata providers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize instances of ProviderA and ProviderB (hypothetically), set different metadata to a single node in each provider, and initialize CSTModule.
  Act: Call on_leave within both providers with a single node and try to get metadata.
  Assert: Assert that metadata retrieved by each provider is respective to what was set in them.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies that each provider instance maintains its own metadata. This test is crucial to guarantying encapsulation rules in the system and ensuring that metadata provided by different providers, even if attached to the same node, do not interfere with each other.

```

Note: All these scenarios consider that the on_leave method is designed to access metadata from a CSTNode successfully after it has been set using the set_metadata method, throw an exception when trying to access not set metadata, and that on_leave can handle situations where metadata has been provided by different providers to the same node.
