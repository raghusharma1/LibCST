```
Scenario 1: Regular execution of the function visit_And_whitespace_after with a node value of "And"
Details:
  TestName: test_regular_execution_with_node_value_and
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's execution when it is passed a node value of "And". The function is not expected to return anything, thus no exceptions should be raised.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with the argument "And"
  Act: Call the function visit_And_whitespace_after with the initialized argument.
  Assert: Verify that no exceptions are raised during the function execution.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the function behaves as expected on a valid input. Since the function is set to return None, we ensure this is done without raising any exception which could hamper the flow of the dependent program operations.

Scenario 2: Execution of the function visit_And_whitespace_after with a node value not of "And"
Details:
  TestName: test_execution_with_node_value_not_and
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behaviour when it is passed a node value that is not "And". As Python is not a statically typed language, passing a different value should not raise any type-related exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with an argument other than "And"
  Act: Call the function visit_And_whitespace_after with the initialized argument.
  Assert: Verify that no exceptions are raised.
Validation:
  Although the function appears to be designed for "And" node, it's important to ensure that it behaves as expected with various inputs, since type-related exceptions are not expected in Python. Even with different input, it should execute without raising any exceptions that disrupt flow of the program.

Scenario 3: Execution of the function visit_And_whitespace_after without any node value
Details:
  TestName: test_execution_without_node_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's execution when no node value is provided. As Python allows calling functions without supplying arguments for all parameters, this test checks the function's behavior without any argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function is being tested without any argument.
  Act: Call the function visit_And_whitespace_after without any argument.
  Assert: Check if any exceptions are raised when the function is called without a node value.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function behaves as expected when called without supplying a node value. Ensuring the function does not raise an exception without an argument boosts confidence in its robustness.
```
Remember that the test scenarios are based on the current structure and instructions of the function, if any modifications occur in the function definitions, the test scenarios may also need to be updated.
