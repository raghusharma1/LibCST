As your question doesn't provide an actual defined function `_codemod_impl`, it's difficult to write specific test scenarios for it. However, based on the information provided, here are few generic test scenarios that could be applied to it:

---
Scenario 1: Check if the libraries imported are being utilized
Details:
  TestName: test_imported_libraries_usage
  Description: This test verifies if the imported libraries in the function are being utilized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Analyse the code to check for imported libraries' usage.
  Act: Run the function with certain parameters.
  Assert: Check if there are any unused libraries.
Validation:
  This is important to ensure the code is clean and all the imported libraries are being used, and there's no unnecessary code bloat.

---
Scenario 2: Check for function's handling of missing or incorrect files
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_file_handling
  Description: Verify how the function handles missing or incorrect files.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a scenario with missing or incorrect file path.
  Act: Run the function with the required parameters, including the false file path.
  Assert: Function should handle the scenario gracefully, perhaps by raising an exception or returning a specific response.
Validation:
  This test makes sure that the function can handle error scenarios and won't crash or halt unexpectedly. This is crucial for real-time applications.

---
Scenario 3: Test method's processing of text files
Details:
  TestName: test_file_processing
  Description: To check how this function processes text files.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a text file with specific contents.
  Act: Run the function with the prepared file.
  Assert: Check if the function processes the file correctly and produces the expected outcome.
Validation:
  A key feature of this function is to process text files. So this test is ensures that the function is correctly implemented and able to perform its core functionality.

---
Scenario 4: Check the command execution and output
Details:
  TestName: test_command_execution
  Description: Verify if the command is correctly executed and expected results are achieved.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the environment and the necessary command.
  Act: Run the function with the command.
  Assert: The result of the command should match the expected outcome.
Validation:
  In a real-world application, making sure the command gives expected results ensures that the function is working as per the requirements and will not cause any application failures or unexpected responses.
