Scenario 1: Validate Command Class Loadings from Various Modules
Details:
  TestName: test_command_class_loading
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the appropriate command class is being loaded from various modules defined in the configuration when the --external argument is not used.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a configuration with modules and a command class that is defined in one of the modules.
  Act: Invoke the _codemod_impl function with the command class name as an argument and without the --external argument.
  Assert: The function should not choke(Should not print error message or return 1). Moreover, the loaded command class should match the expected class.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly identify and load necessary command classes from appropriate modules without requiring external intervention. This may represent a key business requirement.

Scenario 2: Validate Command Class Loading from External Source
Details:
  TestName: test_command_class_loading_from_external
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the correct command class is being loaded from an external source when the  --external argument is used.
Execution:
  Arrange: Import a module externally and define a command class in this module.
  Act: Invoke the _codemod_impl function with the command class name as an argument and with the --external argument.
  Assert: It should load the command class from the external module without any errors and the loaded command class should match the expected class.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function fulfills the requirement of loading command classes from externally referenced modules. This is important for maintaining modularity and flexibility in incorporating new modules.

Scenario 3: Test Codemod Transformation on Files
Details:
  TestName: test_codemod_transformation_on_files
  Description: This test is intended to confirm that codemod transformations are successfully executed on specified files.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a certain number of test files and a command class containing the transformation logic.
  Act: Invoke the _codemod_impl function with the appropriate arguments including the path to the test files and the command.
  Assert: Check the output of the codemod transformation, confirm that the number of transformed files matches the total number of test files, and that the transformation logic was correctly applied to the files.
Validation:
  This test verifies whether the function can correctly apply codemod transformations to specific files which is key to the purpose of the function. Ensuring this aspect is working correctly is critical to meet the intention of the function.

Scenario 4: Test Codemod Transformation Interruption Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_codemod_transformation_interrupt_handling
  Description: This test is meant to validate that the codemod implementation can handle interruptions gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a command class containing the transformation logic and a large lump of test files to ensure a long-running operation.
  Act: Invoke the _codemod_impl function with the appropriate arguments and during its execution simulate a KeyboardInterrupt event.
  Assert: Check that the function prints "Interrupted!" and returns the status code 2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that long-running transformations can be interrupted safely without leading to potentially unrecoverable errors or unwanted side effects.
