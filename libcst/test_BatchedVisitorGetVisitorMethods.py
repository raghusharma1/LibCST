I'm sorry but the information provided is not sufficient to create the test scenarios. You mentioned the function "_get_visitor_methods", but the function definition is not given.

To guide you on how it should be, here is an example;

```
Scenario 1: Test with valid input
Details:
  TestName: test_get_visitor_methods_with_valid_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function returns expected results when provided with valid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a cstNode instance with specific metadata.
  Act: Invoke _get_visitor_methods with the initialized cstNode instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the returned results match the expected results.
Validation:
  This test is important because it ensures _get_visitor_methods is correctly processing valid inputs and producing the expected results.

Scenario 2: Test with invalid input
Details:
  TestName: test_get_visitor_methods_with_invalid_input
  Description: This test is intended to check if the function raises an exception when provided with invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a cstNode instance with invalid metadata.
  Act: Invoke _get_visitor_methods with the-initialized cstNode instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if a specific type of exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This test is important because it secures the function from being misused and assures that the function is behaving expectedly to wrong inputs.
```
For more detailed scenarios, please provide the function "_get_visitor_methods" definition or describe its behavior.

I'm sorry, but there seems to be some misunderstanding. The function "_get_visitor_methods" that I'm supposed to write tests for has not been provided. Could you please redefine your prompt with the function, or clarify what exactly it does in order to proceed?
