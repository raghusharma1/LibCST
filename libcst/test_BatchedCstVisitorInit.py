Scenario 1: Initialize method with valid input test
Details:
  TestName: test_init_with_valid_input
  Description: This test checks if the __init__ method of a visitor correctly initializes according to the expected attributes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of any visitor that inherits from libcst's 'CSTVisitor'.
  Act: Initialize the visitor's class instance using proper attributes.
  Assert: Validate if the visitor instance is correctly created with the specified attributes.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to ascertain the __init__ method's correct functioning, which is essential for its subsequent usage.

Scenario 2: Initialize method with invalid input test
Details:
  TestName: test_init_with_invalid_input
  Description: This test checks if the __init__ method of a visitor throws the expected error when invalid input attributes are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of any visitor that inherits from libcst's 'CSTVisitor'.
  Act: Initialize the visitor's class instance using invalid attributes.
  Assert: Validate if the expected error is thrown due to the invalid input.
Validation:
  Asserting the realization of an error upon testing with invalid input confirms the __init__ method's stringent initialization rules, thereby ensuring the created instances' reliability.

Scenario 3: Visitor's on_visit method test
Details:
  TestName: test_on_visit_method
  Description: This test checks if the on_visit method of any specific created visitor is correctly functioning.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of any visitor that inherits from libcst's 'CSTVisitor'.
  Act: Invoke the on_visit method with their correct attributes.
  Assert: Validate if the on_visit method is functioning as expected, i.e., expected output is provided.
Validation:
  The main purpose of this test to assert the correct functioning of the on_visit method, which is vital in the sequence of operations when the visitor class is utilized.

Scenario 4: Visitor's on_leave method test
Details:
  TestName: test_on_leave_method
  Description: This test focuses on the on_leave method of a specific created visitor to validate its correct functioning.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of any visitor that inherits from libcst's 'CSTVisitor'.
  Act: Invoke the on_leave method with their correct attributes.
  Assert: Validate if the on_leave method is functioning as expected, i.e., expected output is provided.
Validation:
  As the on_leave method is one of the core functions of any visitor class, validating its correct functioning is paramount to the successful implementation of its parent class.

Scenario 5: Duplicate node visit test
Details:
  TestName: test_duplicate_node_visit
  Description: Test to confirm visitor does not re-visit nodes from the input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of any visitor that inherits from libcst's 'CSTVisitor', input CST code with duplicate nodes.
  Act: Run the visitor on the input code.
  Assert: Verify the visitor does not re-visit the duplicate nodes.
Validation:
  The essence of this test is to guarantee the efficiency of the visitor and evade redundancy during code analysis.

Scenario 6: Order of visit test
Details:
  TestName: test_order_of_visit
  Description: Test to confirm the visitor visits the nodes in the correct order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of any visitor that inherits from libcst's 'CSTVisitor', input CST code.
  Act: Run the visitor on the input code.
  Assert: Verify the visit order matches the one expected.
Validation:
  This test is essential in checking the robustness of the visitor as visits in the incorrect sequence might lead to wrong analysis results.
