Scenario 1: Test the visit_Assign_targets when no node is provided
Details:
  TestName: test_no_node_provided
  Description: This test verifies the functionality of the visit_Assign_targets function when no node is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Invoke visit_Assign_targets from a test function without any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function.
  Assert: We expect no output, as the visit_Assign_targets doesn't return anything, the function should run without any error.
Validation:
  This is important to ensure that the function can handle unspecified inputs and behave as expected with respect to its business logic.

Scenario 2: Provide Non-"Assign" Node 
Details:
  TestName: test_non_assign_node
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the function when a node other than "Assign" is provided to the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a node which is not of type "Assign" and pass it to the visit_Assign_targets function.
  Act: Invoke the function.
  Assert: We expect no output from the function; it should run without any error or exception.
Validation:
  Validating this scenario is critical to verify that the function doesnâ€™t break or throw any exception or error when non-"Assign" types are passed.

Scenario 3: Provide a valid "Assign" Node.
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_assign_node
  Description: This test confirms whether the function works as expected when a valid "Assign" node is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a valid "Assign" Node and pass it to the function.
  Act: Invoke the function.
  Assert: As per the function definition, no output is expected. We just need to assert that the function runs without any plugin exceptions.
Validation:
  This verifies that the function works as intended when a node of the correct ("Assign") type is provided. The function should continue to work without throwing any exceptions or errors.

Scenario 4: Ensure idempotence of the function.
Details:
  TestName: test_idempotence
  Description: This test verifies that invoking the function multiple times doesn't change the underlying system's state or cause any unwanted side effects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a valid "Assign" Node and pass it to the function.
  Act: Invoke the function multiple times.
  Assert: No output is expected, and no errors or exceptions should occur on repeated invocations.
Validation:
  Establishing the idempotence of the function is crucial for understanding its behavior and guarantees that repeated execution doesn't cause unintended effects on the system.
