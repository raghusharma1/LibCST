Scenario 1: Verifying the resolve function with valid parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_resolve_valid_params
  Description: This test is intended to verify whether the resolve function checks and extracts required metadata successfully when provided valid parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a metadata provider class instance and initialize MetadataWrapper.
  Act: Call the resolve function on MetadataWrapper instance with the metadata provider instance as parameter.
  Assert: Verify that returned result contains desired metadata.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that resolve function performs as expected when provided with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Verifying the resolve function with a class that is not of type ProviderT
Details:
  TestName: test_resolve_invalid_class_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the resolve function handles the case where the provided class is not of type ProviderT.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a class instance which is not of type ProviderT and initialize MetadataWrapper.
  Act: Call the resolve function on MetadataWrapper instance with the invalid class type as parameter.
  Assert: Verify that ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is required to ensure proper error handling mechanism of the resolve function.

Scenario 3: Verifying cache functionality of resolve function
Details:
  TestName: test_resolve_cache_functionality
  Description: This test is intended to confirm if the resolve function's caching behavior functions correctly and efficiently.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup a metadata provider class instance and add its metadata to the MetadataWrapper instance.
  Act: Invoke resolve function twice on the MetadataWrapper instance with the same provider instance.
  Assert: Check the count of metadata access and confirm it is only once, indicating that the second resolve used the cache.
Validation:
  This test ensures the efficiency of the resolve function that avoids redundant computations by using cached results where possible.

Scenario 4: Verifying resolve function when Provider's metadata has dependencies
Details:
  TestName: test_resolve_with_dependency_providers
  Description: This test is intended to confirm the resolve function's ability to correctly handle metadata providers that have dependencies on other metadata providers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a metadata provider that has dependency on other providers and initialize MetadataWrapper.
  Act: Call resolve on the MetadataWrapper instance with the metadata provider instance.
  Assert: Confirm that dependent metadata providers are resolved correctly and their metadata can be successively accessed.
Validation:
  This test is vital to ensure that the resolve function can handle more complex scenarios where provider's metadata are dependent on other providers.

Scenario 5: Verifying resolve function works on nested nodes
Details:
  TestName: test_resolve_on_nested_nodes
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the resolve function returns metadata correctly for nested CSTNodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up MetadataWrapper with a CSTNode that has multiple nested CSTNodes.
  Act: Call resolve on the MetadataWrapper instance for a nested CSTNode.
  Assert: Verify that resolve returns the correct metadata for the nested CSTNodes.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the resolve function handles nested nodes correctly, which is important for handling complex and nested Python programs.
