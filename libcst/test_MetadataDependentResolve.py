Scenario 1: Test resolve function with inherited dependencies
Details:
    TestName: test_resolve_with_inherited_dependencies
    Description: This test is intended to verify that the resolve function correctly resolves and caches all metadata dependencies declared by `self`. The cache should be cleared once the context manager exits.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a MetadataWrapper object, and a subclass of the BaseMetadataProvider which declares some metadata dependencies.
    Act: Call the resolve function on an instance of the MetadataDependent subclass, passing the MetadataWrapper object as a parameter.
    Assert: Verify that the metadata dependencies are correctly cached in `self.metadata` during the execution of resolve. After the context manager exits, ensure that `self.metadata` has been cleared.
Validation:
    This test is vital because it checks that the resolve function performs its core duties - resolving dependencies and managing the metadata cache.

Scenario 2: Test resolve function without inherited dependencies
Details:
    TestName: test_resolve_without_inherited_dependencies
    Description: Tests the resolve function when `self` does not declare any metadata dependencies. Essentially, this ensures the resolve function behaves as expected when there's no dependencies to resolve and cache.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a MetadataWrapper object, and a subclass of the BaseMetadataProvider that declares no metadata dependencies.
    Act: Call the resolve function on an instance of the MetadataDependent subclass, passing the MetadataWrapper object as a parameter.
    Assert: Confirm that `self.metadata` remain empty as no dependencies would have been cached. After the context manager exits, ensure that `self.metadata` is still empty.
Validation:
    This test guarantees that the resolve function would not throw any errors or behave unexpectedly in case of no declared dependencies.

Scenario 3: Test resolve function with non-existent dependencies
Details:
    TestName: test_resolve_with_non_existent_dependencies
    Description: This test is intended to verify how the resolve function handles dependencies that do not exist in the input MetadataWrapper.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a MetadataWrapper object, and a subclass of the BaseMetadataProvider that declares some non-existent metadata dependencies.
    Act: Call the resolve function on an instance of the MetadataDependent subclass, passing the MetadataWrapper object as a parameter.
    Assert: Ensure that the non-existent dependencies are not cached in `self.metadata`. After the context manager exits, verify that `self.metadata` is cleared.
Validation:
    This is an important negative test case to check the function's robustness and ability to handle invalid dependencies.
