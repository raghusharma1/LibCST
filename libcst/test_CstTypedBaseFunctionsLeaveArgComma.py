Scenario 1: Testing the leave_Arg_comma function when a valid argument is passed
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_Arg_comma_valid_arg
  Description: This test aims to verify the behavior of the leave_Arg_comma function when passed with a valid argument. Given that the function doesn't contain any logic except pass, the business logic to validate is that function should not cause any error or exception when called with a valid argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an Arg object from the nodes imported above.
  Act: Invoke the leave_Arg_comma function, passing in the created Arg object.
  Assert: There's no return value to assert here. The successful completion of the function call itself is the positive outcome here.
Validation:
  Since the function contains no specific business logic and is designed just to be a placeholder/hook, the validation here is that it should not have any unintended side effects or raise any exceptions when called with valid arguments.

Scenario 2: Testing the leave_Arg_comma function when no argument is passed
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_Arg_comma_no_arg
  Description: The test verifies the behavior of the leave_Arg_comma function if it is invoked without any argument. This will validate the error handling capacity of the function when argument is missing.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed in this case.
  Act: Invoke the leave_Arg_comma function without passing an argument.
  Assert: Check for the expected TypeError to be raised since the function signature requires an argument.
Validation:
  While the function is not intended to be called without an argument, it needs to be validated for its failure behavior, ensuring it fails gracefully and as expected when no argument is provided.

Scenario 3: Confirming the function works with various objects derived from "Arg"
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_Arg_comma_variants
  Description: This test is to confirm that the function executes without errors or side effects with various objects that could be considered "Arg" types based on inheritance, as indicated by the type hint in the function definition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate various variants of Arg objects from libcst._nodes.expression module.
  Act: Invoke the leave_Arg_comma method, passing in each variant instance of Arg.
  Assert: Function executes without raising an exception.
Validation:
  As a hook function, leave_Arg_comma should not have specific behaviors or side effects and should be able to accept a range of reasonable inputs. By passing in various "types" of "Arg" objects (derived from Arg), we confirm the function behavior meets expectations across multiple scenarios.
