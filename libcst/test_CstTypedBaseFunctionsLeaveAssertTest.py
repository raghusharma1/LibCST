Scenario 1: Validate Assert Node Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_assert_node_passed
  Description: This test is intended to verify whether the method handles the Assert node correctly when passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class that has the leave_Assert_test method. Initialize an Assert node.
  Act: Invoke the function passing the created Assert node.
  Assert: Assert that the function executed without any exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the leave_Assert_test function can handle Assert nodes with no exceptions thrown, which is important for its role within the parser.

Scenario 2: Validate Method With Non-Assert Node
Details:
  TestName: test_non_assert_node_passed
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the method when a non-Assert node is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class that has the leave_Assert_test method. Initialize a non-Assert node or use Mock to create a dummy object.
  Act: Invoke the function passing the created non-Assert node.
  Assert: Validate that the method successfully executed and returned None without any exception.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the method leaves non-assert nodes untouched which is essential to the overall parser's functioning. 

Scenario 3: Verify Assert Node with Data
Details:
  TestName: test_assert_node_with_data_passed
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the method handles Assert nodes that hold data correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class that has the leave_Assert_test method. Initialize an Assert node with some data.
  Act: Invoke the function with the created Assert node.
  Assert: Assert that the function executed successfully with no exception and returned None.
Validation:
  This test is essential to certify that the function can properly handle and process Assert nodes that hold data, which could impact the overall functionality of the program.

Note: Since the function `leave_Assert_test` doesn't contain any logic and simply passes, the test scenarios mostly check that no exceptions are raised when different cases are handled. However, these tests set the stage for any future modifications to the `leave_Assert_test` function.
