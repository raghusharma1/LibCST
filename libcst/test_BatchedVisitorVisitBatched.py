Unfortunately, no specific function called `visit_batched` that needs to be tested is provided in this question. Therefore, we can only abstractly suggest possible scenarios, without providing concrete parameter values. The scenarios discussed here will be applicable for most code testing situations:

```
Scenario 1: Happy Path Test
Details:
  TestName: test_function_works_as_expected
  Description: This is to validate that the function is working as expected with ideal inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a set of variables with predictable values that are expected by function.
  Act: Call the function using the initialized objects.
  Assert: Assert that the output matches the expected result.
Validation:
  This would help establish that the function works as expected under normal operation.

Scenario 2: Handling Edge Cases
Details:
  TestName: test_function_handles_edge_cases
  Description: This tests if the function handles unexpected or borderline cases without failing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up inputs that represent edge cases.
  Act: Call the function using the prepared inputs.
  Assert: Check that the function handles these cases, either by returning an expected result or gracefully failing.
Validation:
  This assures that the function won't break during edge cases, which could make the whole system unstable.

Scenario 3: Stress Test
Details:
  TestName: test_function_handles_large_inputs
  Description: This tests if the function can handle large amounts of data within reasonable bounds.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up inputs that are larger or more complex than typically expected.
  Act: Call the function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the function completes its task within reasonable time and does not run out of resources.
Validation:
  This test checks whether the function can sustain in a real-world scenario where data can be massive, and ensures it won't crash or hang during those situations.
