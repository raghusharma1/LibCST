``` 
Scenario 1: Testing the function visit_batched with no batchable_visitors.
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_batched_with_no_visitors
  Description: This test validates the functionality of visit_batched when no batchable visitors are provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a CSTNodeT node.
  Act: Invoke the visit_batched method with the created node and an empty list as the `batchable_visitors` 
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the input node back as it doesn't perform any visitor actions.
Validation:
  This test is needed to ensure that the function handles scenarios with no batchable visitors. It should return the original node back as there are no visitors actions performed.

Scenario 2: Testing the function visit_batched with single batchable_visitor
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_batched_with_single_visitor
  Description: This test case verifies the functionality of the visit_batched function when there is only one batchable visitor. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a CSTNodeT node and a BatchableCSTVisitor instance and some tasks for it.
  Act: Invoke the visit_batched method with the created node and the visitor instance as the batchable_visitors 
  Assert: Confirm that the visitor's task was performed on the node and that the modified node is returned.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly applies the single visitor's task on the node. The task should be performed on the node and the modified node should be returned.

Scenario 3: Testing the function visit_batched with multiple batchable_visitors
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_batched_with_multiple_visitors
  Description: This scenario tests how visit_batched handles multiple batchable visitors. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a CSTNodeT node and multiple BatchableCSTVisitor instances each with a unique task.
  Act: Invoke the visit_batched method with the node and the visitor instances in the `batchable_visitors` list 
  Assert: Verify that all the tasks of the batchable visitors were performed on the node and the resulting modified node is returned.
Validation:
  This is an important test because sometimes multiple visitor actions need to be applied on the same node. The function should perform all the visitor's tasks on the node and return the modified node. 

Scenario 4: Testing the function visit_batched with before_visit and after_leave hooks
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_batched_with_hooks
  Description: This test verifies the functionality of visit_batched method when before_visit and after_leave hooks are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a CSTNodeT node, and a BatchableCSTVisitor. Initialize two VisitorMethod instances to serve as the before_visit and after_leave hooks.
  Act: Call the visit_batched method with node, the BatchableCSTVisitor instance, and the hooks.
  Assert: Verify that the hooks and the visitor's task were correctly applied to the node and the modified node is returned.
Validation:
  It is important to ensure the functions' ability to execute additional functionality provided by before_visit and after_leave hooks, which need to be executed around the visitor tasks.
