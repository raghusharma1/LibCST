```
Scenario 1: Testing len with an empty iterable
Details:
  Test Name: test_len_empty
  Description: This test checks the logic of the len method when the incoming iterable is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class with an empty iterable.
  Act: Invoke the len method on the object.
  Assert: The expected output is 0 as len of empty iterable should be 0.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial to ensure that the function len correctly handles the edge case of an empty iterable. The feature's specification suggests that the behaviour should be consistent with the standard Python 'len' function, which returns 0 for an empty iterable.

Scenario 2: Testing len with a single element iterable
Details:
  TestName: test_len_single_element
  Description: This test scrutinizes the len method for a single element iterable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class using a single element iterable.
  Act: Utilize len method on the created object.
  Assert: The expected output is 1 as len of single element iterable should be 1.
Validation:
  This scenario is significant to ascertain that the len function operates correctly for a single element iterable. According to the specification of the function, it should return the count of elements, hence 1 for single element iterable.

Scenario 3: Testing len with multiple elements in the iterable
Details:
  TestName: test_len_multiple_elements
  Description: This scenario checks the behaviour of the len method when multiple elements in the iterable are passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Formulate an object of the class having an iterable of multiple elements.
  Act: Call the len method on this object.
  Assert: The expected outcome will be the length of the iterable which must be equal to the count of elements in the passed iterable.
Validation:
  This scenario is prominent for verifying that the len method can accurately count multiple elements. The function's specifications suggest that it should return a count of elements consistent with the iterable's length passed to the class constructor.

Scenario 4: Validating len with Nested iterable
Details:
  TestName: test_len_nested_iterable
  Description: This test analyses the len method's response when we have a nested iterable as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class with a nested iterable.
  Act: Invoke len method on the object.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the count of only top-level elements. It should not dive into nested layers.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the len function correctly handles nested iterables and summarises only the top-level elements is the core purpose of this scenario. It's crucial verifying its functionality against the specifications which brief same behaviour.
