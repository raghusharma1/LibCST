Scenario 1: Validating the consistency of the get operation.
Details:
  TestName: test_editor_line_consistent
  Description: This test is intended to verify the consistency of the editor_line method. It checks if 'raw_line' maintains the value post its assignment and the method fetches the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class with a message, sequence of lines, 'raw_line' and 'raw_column'.
  Act: Invoke the function 'editor_line' without parameters.
  Assert: Assert if the returned value is the same as the initialised 'raw_line'.
Validation:
  Reasoning behind this test case is to ensure that the method editor_line is returning exactly the same value of the 'raw_line' as there is no logic being applied onto it.

Scenario 2: Correctness of Python's one-indexing.
Details:
  TestName: test_editor_line_one_indexed
  Description: This test intends to confirm the one-indexed characteristic of Python reflected in the output of editor_line method.
Execution:
  Arrange: A class object is to be initiated with 'raw_line' as one of its attributes set to any value.
  Act: Method 'editor_line' needs to be invoked without parameters.
  Assert: Check if 'raw_line' begins with one implying one-indexing in Python, and that the output of 'editor_line' matches the same.
Validation:
  This test case reinforces the one-based indexing system of Python, where first line corresponds to the index 1, and the editor_line() method complies with this system and does not produce an output that suggests zero-based indexing.

Scenario 3: Testing the return type consistency.
Details:
  TestName: test_editor_line_return_type_consistency
  Description: The test verifies if the function always returns an integer output, considering 'raw_line' should always be an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class with 'raw_line' as an integer.
  Act: Call the function 'editor_line' with no parameters.
  Assert: Assert the type of the returned object from 'editor_line' call. It should be an integer.
Validation:
  Ensuring consistency in the return type is crucial. The test case helps us to ensure that the method 'editor_line' returns an integer data type as expected per its specification. This ensures developers can rely upon the return type of function calls during program development.
