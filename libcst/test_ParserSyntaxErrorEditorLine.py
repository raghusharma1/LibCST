To assist you, we would require the complete information regarding the function 'editor_line' whose tests we're supposed to plan. The provided script contains only imports/dependencies, but no clear function definition is provided over which to develop test scenarios. Hence, we could not give specific test scenarios on this.

However, here are examples of how you should define test scenarios using the Pytest framework:

```python
Scenario 1: Verify function's behavior with valid set of parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_function_with_valid_parameters
  Description: This test is aimed to verify if the function 'editor_line' correctly processes the logic when provided with valid set of parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialized the required parameters with valid value sets.
  Act: Invoke the function 'editor_line' with these parameters.
  Assert: Checked if the returned value from the function matches the expected result.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the connection of the expected result to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Verify function's handling of edge cases
Details:
  TestName: test_function_with_edge_cases
  Description: This test is to verify how the function 'editor_line' behaves when provided with edge cases or threshold values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialized the necessary parameters with possible edge values.
  Act: Invoke the function 'editor_line' with these parameters.
  Assert: Checked how the function behaves - whether it handles these cases appropriately or not.
Validation:
  The function's behavior with edge values is crucial to ensure its resilience and fault tolerance, making this test vital.
```

Remember, these are broad examples and will be different based on `editor_line` function's logic, parameters, and usage. Please provide us the function's details so that we can help you in a more specific way.
