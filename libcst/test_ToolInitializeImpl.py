Given the details provided, here are some test scenarios for the _initialize_impl() function. Actual implementation details and results might vary because the description of _initialize_impl() function isn't provided.

```python
Scenario 1: Test for successful initialization
Details:
  TestName: test_initialize_impl_successful
  Description: This test is intended to validate the successful execution of the _initialize_impl function, with all the correct parameters and their respective values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Import necessary module dependencies and prepare arguments with correct values.
  Act: Call the _initialize_impl function with prepared arguments.
  Assert: The function should execute successfully and return the appropriate data.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure that the _initialize_impl function works well with correct parameter values. This test asserts the function's main behavior and aims to validate the main business logic ensuring the overall health of the function.

Scenario 2: Test for ImportError exception 
Details:
  TestName: test_initialize_impl_import_error
  Description: This test verifies that the _initialize_impl function handles ImportErrors properly when a module that does not exist is requested.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare arguments with a module name that doesn't exist.
  Act: Call the _initialize_impl function with prepared arguments.
  Assert: The function should raise an ImportError.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function's behavior is as expected and gracefully handles ImportErrors.

Scenario 3: Test for missing arguments
Details:
  TestName: test_initialize_impl_missing_arguments
  Description: This test verifies that the _initialize_impl function raises an appropriate exception when necessary arguments are missing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Call the function without any arguments.
  Act: Run the _initialize_impl function.
  Assert: The function should raise TypeError indicating missing required positional arguments.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure that the _initialize_impl function shields against invalid usages and maintains the robustness of the application.
  
Scenario 4: Test for functional integrity of the modules
Details:
  TestName: test_initialize_impl_module_integrity
  Description: This test verifies that the _initialize_impl function imports and uses the correct module dependencies without altering their original behaviors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare arguments with the correct values. Import the necessary modules in the test environment.
  Act: Call the _initialize_impl function with the prepared arguments and monitor the usage of the imported modules.
  Assert: The imported modules should behave exactly as they would if called directly, without any changes to their behavior.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function modifies the behavior of the imported modules, thereby preserving the integrity of the external dependencies.
