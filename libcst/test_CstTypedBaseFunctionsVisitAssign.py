Scenario 1: Test Assign Visit Method with an Empty Node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_assign_method_empty_node
  Description: This test verifies that the function visit_Assign does not return an error when provided with an empty node.
Execution:
  Arrange: The test environment includes a node with no data.
  Act: The visit_Assign function is invoked with the empty node.
  Assert: Check if the function does not throw any errors and returns None.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle empty inputs, returning None as expected. This is an essential feature as real-world assignments might be absent within some contexts where this function is invoked.

Scenario 2: Assign Visit Method with an Assigned Node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_assign_method_assigned_node
  Description: This test verifies if the function visit_Assign works correctly when receiving the node that has been assigned.
Execution:
  Arrange: The test environment includes a node with an assignment (Assign node from libcst)
  Act: The visit_Assign function is invoked with the assigned node.
  Assert: Check if the function does not throw any errors and returns None.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle assigned nodes appropriately, returning None as expected. The function is supposed to handle node visits without causing unexpected behaviors in the presence of node assignment.

Scenario 3: Incorrect Node Type Passed to visit_Assign Method
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_assign_method_incorrect_node
  Description: This test is designed to ensure that visit_Assign can handle incorrect node types and that it does not throw a type error if the node type does not match.
Execution:
  Arrange: A different type of node (for instance, an object that is not an instance of Assign from LibCST) for the test scenario.
  Act: The visit_Assign function is invoked with the incorrect node.
  Assert: The test validates whether the method handles the incorrect node gracefully.
Validation:
  This scenario is critical because it checks the function's robustness in handling unexpected node types. This is particularly important in dynamic languages like Python, where type checking often happens at runtime, and exceptions must be handled gracefully.
