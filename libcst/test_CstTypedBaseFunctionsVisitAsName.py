ROOST_METHOD_HASH=visit_AsName_bdb5c07da4
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=visit_AsName_157f1208cf


Scenario 1: The visit_AsName function with a valid AsName Node
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_AsName_with_valid_node
  Description: Ensuring that the function visit_AsName will accept an AsName node type without exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AsName for use as the input node.
  Act: Invoke visit_AsName, passing the node.
  Assert: Ensure that no exception is raised.
Validation:
  The visit_AsName function should accept an AsName node as it is intended to visit AsName nodes.

Scenario 2: Visiting an AsName node that contains specific structure 
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_AsName_with_specific_structure
  Description: To verify that when visit_AsName is called with an AsName node that matches a focus structure, it behaves as expected or triggers certain actions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct and initialize the AsName node to reflect the specific structure.
  Act: Invoke the visit_AsName with the AsName node.
  Assert: Confirm the outcome, whether it is the method's return value, a state change, or exception.
Validation:
  Checking the behavior with specific structures helps reveal any potential bugs or quirks in the code.

Scenario 3: Invoking visit_AsName without an AsName node 
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_AsName_with_none_node
  Description: Checking how visit_AsName behaves when it is invoked without an AsName node.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke visit_AsName without passing in an AsName node. 
  Assert: Ensure that the right exception (TypeError or other) is raised.
Validation:
  Even though Python is dynamically typed, it is important to test a function with different types for flexible handling and error messaging.

Scenario 4: The visit_AsName function with an AsName containing specific data 
Details:
  TestName: test_visit_AsName_with_specific_data
  Description: This will test if the function can handle an AsName node holding specific data and return expected results or execute actions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AsName node with particular data.
  Act: Call visit_AsName, passing the node.
  Assert: The confirmation of expected result or state change.
Validation:
  This scenario represents the function's ability to handle data within its primary input types, which is important for its reliability and consistency.
