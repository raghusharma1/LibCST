ROOST_METHOD_HASH=leave_Assert_msg_1cc82916c5
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=leave_Assert_msg_80acf22464


Scenario 1: Function execution with a standard Assert node with non-null message
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_assert_msg_with_message
  Description: Verify that the function behaves as expected when supplied a standard Assert node and a non-null message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a standard Assert node (from libcst._nodes.statement) with a non-null message.
  Act: Invoke the leave_Assert_msg function, passing the created Assert node.
  Assert: Since function currently doesn't perform any operations, there is nothing to assert or validate.
Validation:
  The function should execute without any exceptions. This tests the function's compatibility with standard Assert objects and verifies no unexpected behavior occurs when a non-null message is used.

Scenario 2: Function execution with an Assert node lacking a message
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_assert_msg_no_message
  Description: Verify the function behavior when provided an Assert node that lacks a message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Assert node (from libcst._nodes.statement) without a message.
  Act: Invoke the leave_Assert_msg function, passing the created Assert node.
  Assert: Since function currently doesn't perform any operations, there is nothing to assert or validate.
Validation:
  The function should execute without any errors. This scenario is intended to confirm that the function performs without causing exceptions when a null message is passed.

Scenario 3: Call function with an Assert node that contains whitespace
Details:
  TestName: test_leave_assert_msg_whitespace
  Description: Evaluate how the function performs when an Assert node containing various types of whitespace is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Assert node with a variety of whitespace characters in the message.
  Act: Call leave_Assert_msg function, providing the configured Assert node.
  Assert: As function currently doesn't perform any operations, there is nothing to assert or validate.
Validation:
  Function should execute without any exceptions. This verifies the functionâ€™s robustness and ability to handle a variety of input cases, including those containing unconventional whitespace characters.
