I'm sorry, but it seems there's a mistake in the question - there's no function provided to write test scenarios. Could you please provide the function "visit_Add_whitespace_after"? That would help to craft the test scenarios.

I'm sorry, but you seem to have left off the method for which you want unit tests. Could you provide the 'visit_Add_whitespace_after' method? This will help me understand the logic and create the appropriate test cases.
