```
Scenario 1: Basic Functionality Test
Details:
  TestName: test_no_local_scheme_basic
  Description: This test will verify the basic functionality of the function no_local_scheme. It will call the function with a valid version string and assert that it returns an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a suitable version string to use as the function argument.
  Act: Call the function no_local_scheme with the prepared version string.
  Assert: Assert that the return value of the function is an empty string.
Validation:
  Since the base functionality of no_local_scheme is to always return an empty string, this test confirms it is working as expected with valid input.

Scenario 2: Functionality with Different Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_no_local_scheme_different_inputs
  Description: This test will verify that the function no_local_scheme behaves as expected with different input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare several different types of valid version strings to be used as function arguments.
  Act: Call the function no_local_scheme multiple times, each time with a different version string from the ones prepared.
  Assert: Assert that every call to the function returns an empty string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the return value of the function is not influenced by the version string passed as input. Even under varying input, the function should adhere to its business logic of returning an empty string. 

Scenario 3: No Input Test
Details:
  TestName: test_no_local_scheme_no_input
  Description: This test will verify the function no_local_scheme's behavior when called without any arguments.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or preparation is required for this scenario.
  Act: Call the function no_local_scheme without any arguments.
  Assert: Assert that the function raises a TypeError.
Validation:
  The function no_local_scheme is expected to take one argument, a version string. This test validates that the function properly handles the case when it is called without any arguments by raising a TypeError.
